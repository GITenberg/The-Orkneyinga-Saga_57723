</div>
<hr class='c006' />
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Orkneyinga Saga</span> is the history of the Orkneymen, Earls
and Odallers of Norwegian extraction, who established an
Earldom of Norway in the Northern Scottish Isles a thousand
years ago, and whose descendants for several centuries held
sway over the Hebrides and Northern Mainland of Scotland.
Commencing with the conquest of the Isles by Harald Harfagri,
the Saga relates the subsequent history of the Earldom
of Orkney under the long line of its Norse Jarls, and is,
for a period of three centuries and a half, the principal
authority for the history of Northern Scotland. The narrative
is mainly personal, and therefore picturesque, pourtraying
the men in person and character, impartially recording their
deeds, and mentioning what was thought of them and their
actions at the time. Occasionally the Saga-writer is enabled
to do this in the words of a contemporary Skald.  The
skaldic songs, so often quoted, were the materials from which
the Sagas were subsequently elaborated. In estimating their
value as historical materials, it must be borne in mind that
all history has begun in song. When great events and mighty
deeds were preserved for posterity by oral recitation alone, it
was necessary that the memory should be enabled to retain
its hold of the elements of the story by some extraneous
artistic aid, and therefore they were welded by the word-smith’s
rhymes into a compact and homogeneous “lay.”
Thus, worked into a poetical setting (as the jeweller mounts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>his gems to enhance their value and ensure their preservation),
they passed as heirlooms from generation to generation,
floating on the oral tradition of the people. Snorri Sturluson
tells us that the songs of the skalds who were with Harald
Harfagri in his wars were known and recited in his day, after
an interval of nearly four centuries. “These songs,” he says,
“which were sung in the presence of kings and chiefs, or of
their sons, are the materials of our history; what they tell of
their deeds and battles we take for truth; for though the
skalds did no doubt praise those in whose presence they stood,
yet no one would dare to relate to a chief what he and those
who heard it knew to be wholly imaginary or false, as that
would not be praise but mockery.” Our earliest Scottish
chroniclers did not disdain to make use of the lay-smith’s
craft, as a help to history, long after the Iceland skald had
been succeeded by the Saga-writer, and the flowery recitative
of an unclerkly age superseded by the terser narrative of the
parchment scribe. The art is as old as Odin and the gods,
if indeed it be not older, and these its creations. But its
golden age had passed ere Paganism began to give way before
Christianity, and the specimens we have in this Saga are
mostly of the period of its decadence and by inferior skalds.
Yet it is significant of the esteem in which the art continued
to be held by the settlers in the Orkneys, that we find Earl
Sigurd honouring Gunnlaug Ormstunga with princely gifts,
Arnor Jarlaskald enjoying the special favour and friendship
of Earl Thorfinn, and Earl Rögnvald, the founder of the
cathedral, courting for himself the reputation of an accomplished
skald.</p>
<p class='c008'>But though we can thus trace to some extent the authorship
of the unwritten materials from which the Saga was
framed, there is nothing to show where or by whom it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>written. There is proof, however, that it was known in
Iceland in the first half of the thirteenth century. Its earlier
chapters, down to the division of the Earldom between
Thorfinn and Brúsi, are incorporated into the Olaf Saga of
Snorri Sturluson, and are there cited as from the “Jarla
Saga,” or Saga of the Earls. It must therefore have been
in existence as a completed work before 1241, the date of
Snorri’s death. The compiler of the Fagrskinna, which is
shown by internal evidence to have been written between
1222 and 1225, also quotes from it, by the title of “Jarla
Sagan.” The closing chapters of the Orkneyinga Saga, in its
present form, recording the burning of Bishop Adam, could
not have been written before 1222; but, as it is stated in the
last chapter that the terrible retribution exacted by the Scottish
King for the murder of the Bishop was still in fresh
memory, it may very well have been completed before 1225.
No manuscript of the Jarla Saga is known to exist, and the
original form of what is now called “The Orkneyinga Saga” is
thus matter of conjecture. We know it only as the substance
of its earlier chapters was given by Snorri previous to 1241,
and in the expanded version of the Flateyjarbók, where it is
pieced into the Sagas of Olaf Tryggvi’s son and Olaf the Holy.
The Flateyjarbók, however, is nearly a century and a half
later than Snorri’s work, having been written between the
years 1387 and 1394.</p>

<p class='c008'>The object of the present issue being simply to provide a
plain, readable, and unadorned translation of the Orkneyinga
Saga (which has been hitherto inaccessible to the English
reader), it has been deemed advisable to adhere to the form of
the Saga adopted by its first editor Jonæus, though not to
Jonæus’s text, which is by no means free from corruptions.
The Christiania edition of the Flateyjarbók, printed literally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>from the manuscript, has afforded the means of rectifying the
text where necessary; and the expanded version of the earlier
chapters given in the Flateyjarbók has also been translated
and inserted as an appendix, for the sake of the fuller details
which it supplies of the earlier history of the Earldom. In
one sense it might have been desirable to have compiled a
text which would have given the fullest history of the Orkney
Earls, but this would not have been the “Orkneyinga Saga.”
It would have necessitated the collection and critical collation
of all the passages in all the Sagas and early writings relating
to the history of the Northmen in Scotland—a work which
has long been in progress in abler hands, and under more
favourable auspices.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Introduction, however, has been compiled with a
view to supplement the Saga narrative, as well as to furnish
a continuation of the history of the Earldom down to the
time when it ceased to form part of the Norwegian dominions.
Some account of the islands previous to the Norse invasion,
and a few notices of their antiquities and ecclesiastical remains,
as well as of the existing traces of the Norsemen,
seemed requisite to supplement the notes in illustration of
the text. Chronological and Genealogical Tables have been
added to facilitate reference; and on the maps of Scotland
and of the island-groups which formed the Earldom proper are
shown the names of the principal places mentioned in the
Sagas as known to the Northmen.</p>

<p class='c008'>In conclusion, I have to express my obligations to those
kind friends who have aided me with their advice and assistance.
To Dr. John Stuart, Dr. John Hill Burton, Sir Henry
Dryden, Bart., and Colonel Balfour of Balfour and Trenaby, I
am indebted for many valuable suggestions. To the first-named
gentleman I am also under obligations for the use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>of the woodcuts of the symbols of the Sculptured Stones.
The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland have generously contributed
the woodcuts of the Bressay Stone, the Saverough
Bell, and the Sword and Scabbard-tip; to the Society of
Antiquaries of London I am indebted for the illustrations
of the Stones of Stennis; to Mr. James Ferguson and Mr.
John Murray for those of Maeshow; to Mr. Thomas S.
Muir for the Dragon of Maeshow, the etchings of the
churches of Weir and Lybster, and the ground-plans of
the ancient churches; to Messrs. Chambers for the woodcut
of Mousa; and to Dr. Daniel Wilson and Messrs. Constable
for those of the Brooch and Comb, illustrating the burial-usages
of the Norsemen. The view of Egilsey church is from
a photograph, for which I am indebted to Mr. George Petrie
of Kirkwall, whose pleasant companionship in a pilgrimage
among the localities described in the Saga is gratefully
remembered.</p>

<h3 id='h3-I' class='c016'>I. <span class='sc'>Earliest Historical Notices of the Orkneys.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'>The historical notices of the Orkneys previous to the Norse
occupation are few in number, and exceedingly obscure. We
learn little more from the allusions of the Roman writers
than that scarcely anything was known to them with
certainty of these remote localities. It may be inferred,
however, that the first wave of Celtic population that
overspread the northern mainland of Britain must have
gradually extended northward to the outlying Isles. The
correspondence of the early remains found in the Islands with
those of northern Scotland is of itself a striking testimony to
the connection of their early population with the Celtic stock
of the northern mainland of Scotland. We gather from these
remains that the earliest population of the Islands, of which
we have any reliable evidence, lived in the same manner as
the natives of the northern mainland, fought with the same
varieties of weapons of stone and bronze, erected the same
forms of defensive structures, practised the same funereal
rites, and constructed similar forms of sepulchral chambers,
over which they piled the great mounds which are among
the most striking features of an Orkney landscape.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a> The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>number and magnitude of these monuments and structural
remains bear witness in a most remarkable manner to the
activity, intelligence, and social organisation of the times that
have no other record.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not until the middle of the 5th century of the
Christian era that the early chronicles begin to cast occasionally
a feeble and uncertain light upon the history of the
northern isles. It is stated in the “Historia Britonum” of
Nennius that the Saxon chiefs Ochtha and Ebissa, who came
over with “forty keels” in the year 449, laid waste the Orkney
Islands, and seized a great many regions beyond the Frisic
Sea.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a> At that time, and for a long period previously (according
to Nennius), the Picts had been in possession of the
Orkneys. Whatever value may be attached to these statements
as referring to events which took place 400 years before
the author’s own time, there can be no reason for discrediting
his testimony when he says that the Picts continued in
possession of the Orkneys in his day.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c017'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Adamnan, in his Life of St. Columba, mentions that the
saint being on a visit to Bruide Mac Meilcon, king of the
Northern Picts, at his stronghold on the river Ness, requested
the king to recommend to the <i>reguli</i> of the Orkneys (one of
whom was then present, and whose hostages were then in the
king’s hands) that Cormac and the clerics who had accompanied
him on a missionary voyage to the Orkneys should
receive no harm; and it is added that this was the means of
saving them from a violent death. But if the authority and
influence of the king of the Northern Picts extended to these
islands in the reign of Bruide, it does not seem to have been
effectual in protecting them from foreign invasion. Bruide
Mac Meilcon died in 584, and some time before his death the
new and rising power of the Dalriadic kings had made itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>felt as far as the Orkneys. In the Annals of Ulster there is
a notice under the year 580 of an expedition against the
Orkneys by Aedan, son of Gabran, seventh king of the
Dalriad Scots, who, coming over from Ireland (then called
Scotia) about the year 503, had established themselves in
Argyle and the Western Highlands, and founded the kingdom
of Dalriada. From the date of Aedan’s expedition in 580 we
have no mention of the islands in the native chronicles for a
whole century, and the next entry, which occurs under the
year 682, gives colour to the supposition that they may have
been under Dalriadic rule in the interval. The record in
682 is simply, that the Orkneys were wasted by Bruide
Mac Bile, the king of the Northern Picts, and apparently
brought once more under the rule of the Northern Pictish
kings.</p>
<h3 id='h3-II' class='c016'>II. <span class='sc'>Early Christianity of the Islands.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'>It is probable that both the island groups of Orkney and
Shetland were visited at a very early period by wandering
clerics of the Irish Church, whose missionary efforts contributed
so much to the diffusion of Christianity in Scotland.
But we have no record of an earlier visitation than that of
the companions of St. Columba, although there are indications
that between that time and the colonisation of the islands by
the heathen Northmen, these Irish clerics were no strangers
in any of the island groups.</p>
<p class='c008'>The Irish monk Dicuil, who wrote his treatise “De Mensura
Orbis Terrarum” in or about the year 825, states that “thirty
years before that time some clerics had told him that they
had lived in an island which they supposed to be Thule,
where at the summer solstice the sun only hid himself behind
a little hill for a short time during the night, which was quite
light; and that a day’s sail towards the north would bring
them from thence into the frozen sea.” This island is obviously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>Iceland. He then states that there are many other islands in
the northern British sea, which lie at the distance of two days
and two nights from the northern islands of Britain, in a
straight course, and with a fair wind and a full sail. “One
of these,” he says, “a certain honest monk told me he had
visited one summer after sailing a day, a night, and another
day, in a two-benched boat.” These appear to be the Shetland
Islands. Dicuil further states that “there are also some other
small islands, almost all divided from each other by narrow
sounds, inhabited for about a century by hermits proceeding
from our Scotia;<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c017'><sup>[4]</sup></a> but as they had been deserted since the
beginning of the world, so are they now abandoned by these
anchorites on account of the Northern robbers; but they are
full of countless sheep, and swarm with sea-fowl of various
kinds. We have not seen these islands mentioned in the
works of any author.” Here the reference to the “small
isles separated by narrow sounds” is distinctive of the Faroes,
of which the long narrow sounds are the peculiar physical
feature; while the statement that they are full of countless
sheep, taken in connection with the fact that the
Northmen named them “Sheep-isles” (Fær-eyiar), establishes
the identity of the group which Dicuil describes.
The Faroes were colonised by “the Northern robbers,” led
by Grim Kamban, in 825, the very year in which Dicuil
was writing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first Norwegian settlement was made in Iceland in
875, by Leif and Ingulf, who carried with them a number of
Irish captives; and the Landnamabók states that “before Iceland
was colonised from Norway, men were living there whom
the Northmen called Papas; they were Christians, and it is
thought they came over the sea from the west, for after them
were found Irish books, and bells, and crosiers, and other
things, so that one could see that they were Westmen: these
things were found in Papey, eastwards, and in Papyli.” Again,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>in the Islendingabók of Ari Frodi the same reason is assigned
for the departure of the monks as is given by Dicuil. Ari
Frodi also says, speaking of Iceland:—“Christian men were
here then called by the Northmen <i>Papa</i>, but afterwards they
went their way, for they would not remain in company with
heathens; and they left behind them Irish books, and bells,
and pastoral staves, so that it was clear that they were
Irishmen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus by the concurrent testimony of Adamnan, the biographer
of St. Columba, himself an abbot of the monastery
of Hy; of the Irish monk Dicuil, writing during the lifetime
of the men who had fled from the Northern robbers; and
lastly, of the Icelandic historians themselves—it is established
that the whole of the northern islands were visited by
Christian teachers, and probably, in part at least, converted to
the Christian faith, before they were overrun by the Norwegian
invaders, and the new faith swallowed up in the rising
tide of heathenism thrown upon their shores from the land of
Odin and the Aser.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the absence of all record we cannot expect to ascertain
to what extent these early missionary settlements had succeeded
in leavening the Celtic population of the islands of
Orkney and Shetland with the Christian faith. But it seems
probable that during the three centuries that intervened between
the coming of Cormac in his coracle and the arrival of
Harald Harfagri with his fleet of war galleys, the new faith
had been firmly established and widely extended both in the
northern mainland of Scotland and in the remoter isles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The indications which point to a Christian occupation of
the isle, of no inconsiderable extent and continuance, previous
to their occupation by the Norsemen, are:—The dedications
of the early ecclesiastical foundations; the occurrence of
monumental stones sculptured in the style peculiar to the
earliest Christian monuments of the mainland of Scotland,
and bearing inscriptions in the Ogham character; the finding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>(as at Saverough and Burrian) of ecclesiastical bells of the
square-sided form, peculiar to the early ages of the Church;
and the occurrence in the Norse topography of the islands of
place-names indicative of the previous settlement of Celtic
Christian priests.</p>

<div id='i-xiv'  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/xiv.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>SQUARE-SIDED BELL FOUND AT SAVEROUGH, ORKNEY.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The earliest dedications were probably those to St. Ninian
and St. Columba, St. Brigid, and St. Tredwell. It may be
significant that in the south parish of South Ronaldsay, where
in all probability the companions of St. Columba would make
their first landing in Orkney, there were no fewer than three
chapels dedicated to him.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c017'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>The sculptured monuments furnish us with three collateral
lines of inference, tending to the same conclusion. These
inferences are derived from the inscriptions, the ornamentation,
and the symbols of the monuments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two of these monuments bear inscriptions in the Ogham
character, a style of cryptographic writing characteristic of
the early inscribed stone monuments of Ireland, but occurring
also in Cornwall, in Wales, and in Scotland. One of these
two was found near the ancient church of Culbinsbrugh, in
the island of Bressay in Shetland. It is a slab of chlorite
slate, 4 feet in length, about 16 inches wide at the top, tapering
to a little less than a foot at the bottom, and about 1¾
inch thick. It is sculptured on both sides in low relief, and
the inscription is incised on the edges of the stone. On one
of its sculptured faces it bears the Christian emblem of the
cross, and among the figures sculptured on it are those of two
ecclesiastics with pastoral staves (see <a href='#i-xvi'>Plates</a>). The other
inscribed stone was found by Dr. William Traill in the Pictish
Tower or “Broch” of Burrian, in North Ronaldsay in Orkney.
The inscription scratched on it has not yet been deciphered.
It also bears the Christian emblem of the cross. The association
of the cross with these Ogham inscriptions<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c017'><sup>[6]</sup></a> points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>to a period anterior to the Norse occupation of the
islands.</p>

<p><span class='small'>THE BRESSAY STONE.</span><br /><span class='small'>Showing the other side and Ogham inscription on edge.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>In examining the characteristics of the art of these monumental
stones, we are guided to similar conclusions. The
Bressay stone bears none of the symbols peculiar to the
Scottish monuments, and in its artistic features it comes
nearer to some of the Irish than to the general style of the
Scottish sculptures. It is sculptured in low relief, while all
the Orkney examples are merely incised. But some of the
forms of their ornamentation are also characteristic of the art
of the illuminated Irish manuscripts of the 7th and 8th centuries,
and others are equally characteristic of the art of the
bronzes of what has been styled the late Celtic period.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Scottish sculptured monuments scattered over the
territory ranging from the Forth to the Orkneys are characterised
by a peculiar set of symbols of unknown significance,
which are often associated with the Christian emblem of the
cross.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c017'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The symbol which is of most frequent occurrence,
and which may therefore be said to be the most characteristic
of the period of the monuments, is a crescent conjoined with
what has been called a double sceptre, as represented in the
first figure of the accompanying Plate.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>SYMBOLS ON THE SCULPTURED STONES OF SCOTLAND.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c008'>This characteristic symbol occurs on a sculptured slab
which was found built into St. Peter’s Church in South
Ronaldsay, and which had evidently formed part of a monument
older than the church. It occurs also on the slab found
at Firth, on the mainland of Orkney. Most singularly, it
occurs on the phalangial bone of an ox which was found in
the Broch of Burrian along with the slab previously described
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>as bearing an Ogham inscription and a peculiar form of cross.
It occurs associated with the same form of cross on the elaborately-sculptured
stone at Ulbster in Caithness. We have
this crescent symbol also associated with the cross on the
inscribed stone of St. Vigeans in Forfarshire. This stone
bears the only inscription which is known to have been left
to us in the Pictish language:—<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c017'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The indications afforded by the Norse topography of the
Islands, if taken in connection with the passages previously
quoted from the Landnamabók and the Islendingabók of Ari
Frodi regarding the origin of the names Papa and Papyli in
Iceland, require only to be mentioned. The most obvious of
these are the frequency with which the name Papa<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c017'><sup>[9]</sup></a> occurs
both in the topography of Orkney and Shetland, and the
occurrence of such names as St. Ninian’s Isle in Shetland,
Rinansey (Ringan’s-ey, St. Ninian’s Isle) in Orkney, Daminsey,
now Damsey (St. Adamnan’s Isle), and Enhallow (Eyin-Helga,
Holy Isle), given, we must suppose, intelligently by the
Norsemen.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>Thus, at the very starting-point of their recorded history,
we find indications of Christianity, with suggestions even of
its civilisation and its art shedding their benign influence
over the isles.</p>
<h3 id='h3-III' class='c016'>III. <span class='sc'>Arrival of the Northmen, and Establishment of the Earldom of Orkney and Caithness.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'>The earliest notice we have of the visits of the Northmen
to the shores of Britain occurs in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle
under the date <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 787:—</p>
<p class='c020'>“In this year King Beorhtric took Eadburh, King Offa’s daughter,
to wife. And in his days first came three ships of Northmen from
Hæretha-land; and then the reeve rode thereto, and would drive
them to the king’s vill, for he knew not what they were, and they
there slew him. These were the first ships of Danish men that sought
the land of the English race.”</p>

<p class='c021'>As they came from Hæretha-land, now Hördaland, on the
west coast of Norway, they were Norwegians, not Danes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Irish Annals and the Welsh Chronicles agree in
representing the first inroads of the Norsemen on the Irish
coasts as having commenced in the year 795. In 798 they
plundered Inispatrick of Man and the Hebrides; in 802, and
again in 806, they ravaged Iona, slaying in the latter year
sixty-eight of the monastic family there. In 807 they established
themselves on the mainland of Ireland; and a few
years afterwards we find a Norseman making Armagh the
capital of his kingdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 852, Olaf the White, a chieftain descended from the
same family as Harald Harfagri, conquered Dublin, and
founded the most powerful and permanent of the Norse kingdoms
in Ireland.</p>

<p class='c008'>By the victory of Hafursfiord in 872, Harald Harfagri
made himself sole monarch of Norway. Large numbers of
the wealthy and powerful odallers, whom he had dispossessed
of their territorial possessions, fled to the islands of Orkney
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>and Shetland, which, for a full century previous to this time,
had been well known to the Norsemen as the viking station
of the western haf—the rendezvous of the Northern rovers,
who swept the coasts of the Hebrides and swarmed in the
Irish Seas. Being fugitives from their country, and outlaws
of the new kingdom which Harald had succeeded in establishing
in Norway, they settled themselves permanently in the
islands. Then they turned their haven of refuge into a base
of operations for retaliatory warfare, harrying the coasts of
Norway during the summer months, and living at leisure in
the islands during winter on the plunder. At length King
Harald, irritated by their incessant ravages, collected a powerful
fleet, and visiting Shetland, Orkney, and the Hebrides, in
succession, he swept their coasts clear of the plunderers, subduing
the whole of the Northern and Western islands as far
south as Man.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this expedition Ivar, a son of Rögnvald, Earl of Moeri,
was killed.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c017'><sup>[10]</sup></a> In order to recompense Rögnvald for the loss of
his son, King Harald bestowed on him the territory of the
subjugated isles of Orkney and Shetland, with the title of
Earl of the Orkneys. Harald seems to have dealt similarly
with the Hebrides, but his conquest of the vikings in these
remote isles was not so complete as in the Orkneys. Ketil
Flatnef (Flat nose), who, according to the Laxdæla Saga, had
emigrated to the Hebrides because he could not resist King
Harald in Norway, had married his daughter Aud to Olaf
the White, the powerful king of Dublin, and had established
himself in a kind of independent sovereignty in the
Hebrides; and though he seems to have migrated from them
to Iceland in consequence of King Harald’s expedition, the
continued hostility to King Harald’s rule is evinced by the fact
that the second earl whom he sent to the Hebrides, AsBjörn
Skerablesi, was slain by two relatives of Ketil Flatnef, his
wife and daughter taken captive, and the latter sold as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>slave. Rögnvald, however, returned to his own Earldom in
Norway, and made over his newly-acquired possessions to
his brother Sigurd, the “first earl” of the Saga.</p>

<h3 id='h3-IV' class='c016'>IV. <span class='sc'>The Earldom in the Norse Line</span>, 872-1231.</h3>
<p class='c007'>Thorstein the Red, son of Olaf the White, king of Dublin,
came then to the north, and allying himself with Earl Sigurd,
they crossed over to the mainland of Scotland, and subdued
Caithness and Sutherland as far as Ekkialsbakki, and afterwards
carried their conquests into Ross and Moray. In this
invasion Earl Sigurd killed Maelbrigd the buck-toothed (Melbrigda
tönn), a Scottish maormor of Ross or Moray; and
having tied his head to his saddle-bow, “the tooth,”
which was very prominent, inflicted a wound on his leg, and
the wound inflaming caused the death of the earl, who was
hoy-laid (buried in a mound or cairn) on Ekkialsbakki.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c017'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
After his death, Thorstein the Red reigned as king over the
conquered districts of Scotland, which at that time, says
the Landnamabók,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c017'><sup>[12]</sup></a> comprehended “Caithness and Sutherland,
Ross and Moray, and more than the half of Scotland.” The
Laxdæla Saga<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c017'><sup>[13]</sup></a> says that in his engagements with the Scots
Thorstein was always successful, “until at length he became
reconciled with the King of the Scots, and obtained possession
of the half of Scotland, over which he became king.” But
he was shortly afterwards slain in Caithness by the treachery
of the Scots; and after his death Aud, his mother, migrated
to Iceland. Previous to her departure she had given Groa,
the daughter of Thorstein, in marriage to Duncan, earl or
maormor of Duncansby in Caithness. Thus the Norse earldom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>of Caithness passed for a time into the family of one of
its native chiefs. But by the subsequent marriage of Grelauga,
the daughter of Duncan and Groa, with Thorfinn Hausakliuf,
son of Torf-Einar, Earl of Orkney, the Scottish earldom was
again added to the earldom of the Isles.</p>

<p class='c008'>While Thorstein the Red ruled on the northern mainland
of Scotland, Guttorm, the son of Sigurd Eysteinson, had succeeded
to the Orkney earldom on the death of his father, but
after having held it for one year he died childless.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meantime, when Rögnvald, Earl of Moeri, heard in Norway
of the death of his brother Sigurd, he obtained a grant of the
earldom of Orkney from King Harald for his own son Hallad.
Hallad found the Islands so much infested by vikings that he
soon gave up the earldom in disgust, and returned to Norway,
preferring the life of a farmer to that of an earl.<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c017'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Then Rögnvald sent another son, Einar, to take possession
of the earldom. Einar was a man of a different stamp
from Hallad. He soon made his power felt among the
western vikings, and freed his possessions entirely from their
ravages. The sons of Harald Harfagri, Halfdan Hálegg
and Guthrod, grew up to be men of great violence. One
spring they went north to Moeri and burnt Earl Rögnvald in
his own house with sixty of his men. Halfdan Hálegg then
sailed west to Orkney to dispossess Einar of the earldom,
but having allowed himself to be surprised by Einar, he was
captured in Rinansey, and killed by having a blood-eagle cut
on his back.<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c017'><sup>[15]</sup></a> Harald Harfagri came west, and fined the
Orkneys in sixty marks of gold for the death of his son.
Earl Einar offered to the Bœndr<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c017'><sup>[16]</sup></a> that he would pay the
money on condition that he should have all the odal possessions
in the islands—a condition to which they agreed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>more readily, says the Saga, “that all the poorer men had
but small lands, while those who were wealthy said they
would redeem theirs when they pleased.”<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c017'><sup>[17]</sup></a> But the odal lands
remained in the possession of the earl till Einar’s great-grandson,
Sigurd Hlödverson, was obliged to buy the assistance
of the odallers against the Scots when hard pressed by the
Scottish earl Finnleik.<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c017'><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>When Einar died he left three sons, two of whom, Arnkell
and Erlend, were killed with King Erik Bloodyaxe in England.
The third, Thorfinn Hausakliuf, married Grelauga, daughter
of Duncan, earl of Duncansbay, and thus reunited in the
Norse line the two earldoms of Orkney and Caithness. Earl
Thorfinn Hausakliuf left five sons. Arnfinn, the eldest, who
was married to Ragnhild, a daughter of King Erik Bloodyaxe,
was killed by his wife at Myrkhol (Murkle) in Caithness.
She then married Havard, his brother. She soon tired of him,
and instigated Einar Klining, his sister’s son, to kill him.
Havard fell in the fray at Stennis, and was buried there.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c017'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
Ragnhild had promised to marry Einar if he killed her
husband Havard. When the deed was done, however, she
refused to perform her promise, and instigated another Einar,
by the promise of her hand, to slay Einar Klining. This he
did, but again Ragnhild was faithless. Then she married
Liot, the third son of Earl Thorfinn Hausakliffer, and brother
of the two husbands whom she had already had and slain.
Meanwhile Skuli, a fourth brother, had gone to Scotland and
obtained an earl’s title for Caithness from the King of Scots.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c017'><sup>[20]</sup></a>
He was defeated by Liot, and slain in the Dales of Caithness,
and thus Liot became sole earl of Caithness and Orkney. He
fell in battle with a native chieftain, named Magbiód<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c017'><sup>[21]</sup></a> in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>Sagas, at Skida Myre<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c017'><sup>[22]</sup></a> (Skitten) in Caithness, and was succeeded
in the earldom by Hlödver, the last of the five brothers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Hlödver married Audna, the daughter of the Irish
king Kiarval. He died shortly after his accession to the
earldom, and was buried at Hofn (Huna) in Caithness.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c017'><sup>[23]</sup></a> His
son Sigurd, sometimes called “the Stout,” succeeded him. He
is said to have been a mighty warrior, and to have driven the
Scots completely from Caithness.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c017'><sup>[24]</sup></a> But he was not left in
undisturbed possession of his Scottish earldom. The Scottish
earl or maormor, Finlay (MacRuari?) invaded Caithness and
gave him battle at Skida Myre, where his uncle Liot had
fallen before another Scottish maormor not long previously.
Finlay had so large a force that there were no less than seven
Scotsmen to one of Sigurd’s men, and the Orkneymen who
were with Earl Sigurd were unwilling to fight against such
odds. Then Sigurd offered to restore to the Bœndr their
allodial lands, which they had resigned to Earl Einar, his
great-grandfather. By this means, more than by the charmed
raven-banner made for him by his Irish mother, he obtained
the victory. “After this,” says the Njal Saga,<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c017'><sup>[25]</sup></a> “Earl Sigurd
became ruler over these dominions in Scotland, Ross and
Moray, Sutherland and the Dales” (of Caithness), which seem
also to include the old Strathnaver. But his troubles with
the Scots were not yet over. Caithness was invaded by two
Scottish maormors, called Hundi and Melsnati in the Saga.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c017'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
A battle took place at Duncansbay, in which Melsnati was
slain, but Hundi fled, and the Norsemen, learning that another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>Scottish earl, Malcolm, was assembling an army at Duncansbay,
gave up the pursuit and returned to Orkney. Afterwards
Sigurd became reconciled to Malcolm, King of the Scots, and
obtained his daughter in marriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the most notable event in the life of Earl Sigurd was
that which befel him as he lay in the harbour of Osmondwall
shortly after his accession to the earldom. Olaf Tryggvason,
King of Norway, returning from a western cruise, happened
to run his vessels into the same harbour, as the Pentland
Firth was not to be passed that day. On hearing that the
earl was there he sent for him on board his ship, and told
him, without much parley, that he must allow himself to be
baptized, and make all his people profess the Christian faith.
The Flateyjarbók says that the king took hold of Sigurd’s boy,
who chanced to be with him, and drawing his sword, gave
the earl the choice of renouncing for ever the faith of his
fathers, or of seeing his boy slain on the spot. In the position
in which he found himself placed, Sigurd became a
nominal convert, but there is every reason to believe that the
Christianity which was thus forced upon the Islanders was
for a long time more a name than a reality. Nearly twenty
years afterwards we find Earl Sigurd bearing his own raven-banner
“woven with mighty spells,” at the battle of Clontarf,
against the Christian king Brian; and Sigurd’s fall was made
known in Caithness by the twelve weird sisters (the Valkyriar
of the ancient mythology) weaving the woof of war:—<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c017'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The woof y-woven</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With entrails of men,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The warp hardweighted</div>
      <div class='line in1'>With heads of the slain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>An incident which occurred just before he set out for
Ireland gives a striking illustration of the fierce manners of
the times. King Sigtrygg, who had come from Dublin to
obtain Earl Sigurd’s aid, was being entertained at the Yule-feast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>in Earl Sigurd’s hall in Hrossey (the Mainland of
Orkney), and was set on the high seat, having Earl Sigurd on
the one side and Earl Gilli, who had come with him, on the
other. Gunnar Lambi’s son was telling the company the
story of the burning of Njal and his comrades, but giving an
unfair version of it, and every now and then laughing out
loud. It so happened that as, in answer to an inquiry of
King Sigtrygg’s how they bore the burning, he was saying
that one of them had given way to tears, one of Njal’s friends,
Kari by name, who had just arrived in Orkney, chanced to come
into the hall. Hearing what was said, Kari drew his sword, and
smote Gunnar Lambi’s son on the neck with such a sharp blow
that his head spun off on to the board before the king and the
earls, so that the board was all one gore of blood, and the earls’
clothing too. Earl Sigurd called out to seize Kari and kill
him, but no man stirred, and some spoke up for him, saying
that he had only done what he had a right to do, and so Kari
walked away, and there was no hue and cry after him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The battle of Clontarf, in which Earl Sigurd fell, is the
most celebrated of all the conflicts in which the Norsemen
were engaged on this side of the North Sea. “It was at
Clontarf, in Brian’s battle,” says Dasent, “that the old and
new faiths met in the lists face to face for their last struggle,”
and we find Earl Sigurd arrayed on the side of the old faith,
though nominally a convert to the new. The Irish account
of the battle<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c017'><sup>[28]</sup></a> describes it as seen from the walls of Dublin,
and likens the carnage to a party of reapers cutting down a
field of oats. Sigurd is described as dealing out wounds and
slaughter all around—“no edged weapon could harm him,
and there was no strength that yielded not, and no thickness
that became not thin before him.” Murcadh, son of Brian
Borumha, was equally conspicuous on the side of the Irish.
He had thrice passed through the phalanx of the foreigners,
slaying a mail-clad man at every stroke. Then perceiving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>Sigurd, he rushed at him, and by a blow of his right-hand
sword, cut the fastenings of his helmet, which fell back, and
a second blow given with the left-hand sword cut into his
neck, and stretched him lifeless on the field. In the Njal
Saga the incidents connected with Earl Sigurd’s death are
differently related. His raven-banner, which was borne
before him, was fulfilling the destiny announced by Audna,
when she gave it to him at Skida Myre, that it would always
bring victory to those before whom it was borne, but death to
him who bore it. Twice had the banner-bearer fallen, and
Earl Sigurd called on Thorstein, son of Hall of the Side, next
to bear the banner. Thorstein was about to lift it, when
Asmund the White called out, “Don’t bear the banner, for all
they who bear it get their death.” “Hrafn the Red!” cried
Earl Sigurd, “bear thou the banner.” “Bear thine own
devil thyself,” said Hrafn.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c017'><sup>[29]</sup></a> Then said the earl, “’Tis fittest
that the beggar should bear the bag,” and with that he took
up the banner, and was immediately pierced through with a
spear. Then flight broke out through all the host.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the news of Earl Sigurd’s death reached Scotland
King Malcolm gave the earldom of Caithness to Thorfinn,
his daughter’s son by Sigurd, then only five years of age, and
Sumarlidi, Brúsi, and Einar, Sigurd’s sons by his former marriage,
divided the Orkneys between them. Sumarlidi soon
died, and Einar got his portion. Einar made himself unpopular
by the violence with which he exacted his services
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>from the Bœndr for his viking expeditions, and was killed by
Thorkel Fóstri (Amundi’s son) at Sandwick, in Deerness.
Brúsi then took possession of the whole earldom of the
Orkneys, as Thorfinn had that of Caithness. Thorfinn, however,
claimed a share of the Islands, and as he had the assistance
of his grandfather Malcolm, the King of Scots, Brúsi felt
himself unable to cope with him. He therefore went to
Norway to negotiate with King Olaf Haraldson for a grant
of the whole of the earldom of the Islands. Thorfinn followed
him on the same errand, but the king was more than a match
for them both, and the result was that he gave each a third of
the Islands, declaring the third which had belonged to Earl
Einar to be forfeited to himself for the murder of his friend
and henchman Eyvind Urarhorn, whom Einar had slain in
revenge for Eyvind’s helping the Irish king Conchobhar against
him at Ulfreksfiord. After Thorfinn’s departure, however, he
gave Brúsi to understand that he was to have the forfeited third
of the earldom, as well as his own third, to enable him to hold
his own against Thorfinn. An arrangement was afterwards
made between Brúsi and Thorfinn that the latter should
receive two-thirds of the Islands on condition of his undertaking
the defence of the whole, as they were at that time
much exposed to the predatory incursions of Norse and
Danish vikings.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Thorfinn’s maternal grandfather, King Malcolm,
died, Kali Hundason<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c017'><sup>[30]</sup></a> took the kingdom in Scotland. He
attempted to exact tribute from Thorfinn for his dominions in
the north of Scotland, and failing in this he sent his sister’s
son, Moddan, into Caithness, giving him the title of Earl.
Thorfinn was supported by the inhabitants, however, and after
an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself in Caithness, Moddan
returned to King Kali with the news that Thorfinn was
plundering in Ross and Sutherland. King Kali embarked a considerable
force in eleven ships at Beruvik (apparently Berriedale
on the southern frontier of Caithness), and sent Moddan northwards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>by land with another division of his army, intending
to enclose Thorfinn in the north-east corner of Caithness, and
attack him from two sides at once. Thorfinn, however, was
aware of the trap laid for him, and retired to the Islands.
There Kali came up with him off Deerness, in Orkney, and a
fierce battle took place, in which Kali was defeated. He fled
southwards, and Thorfinn, following him, obliged him again to
give battle at Baefiord, where he was again defeated, while
Thorkel Fóstri fell upon Moddan at Thurso and slew him.
Then, say the Sagas, Earl Thorfinn overran Scotland as far
south as Fife, burning and slaying, and subduing the land
wherever he went. By these conquests he became the most
powerful of all the Earls of Orkney.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rögnvald Brusison was in Norway when he heard of his
father’s death, and being odal-born to his father’s third of the
Islands, and having received from King Magnus Olafson a
grant of that third which King Olaf had declared forfeited to
himself for Eyvind Urarhorn’s murder, he went west to the
Orkneys, prepared to maintain his rights against the claims
of Thorfinn, who had taken possession of the whole. An
amicable arrangement was made between the kinsmen, and
they joined their forces for viking forays upon the Hebrides,
venturing even upon an extensive foray in England during
the absence of Hardicanute in Denmark. After an eight
years’ alliance, however, discord broke out between the kinsmen,
and in a sea-fight in the Pentland Firth, off Rauda
Biorg,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c017'><sup>[31]</sup></a> in Caithness, Rögnvald was defeated and fled, and
Thorfinn reduced the whole of the Islands. Rögnvald went
to Norway, and stayed some time with King Magnus. Then
he came west to the Islands in a single ship, and surprising
Thorfinn in a house on the Mainland of Orkney, he set fire to
it. Thorfinn broke down part of the wall of the house and
leapt out, carrying his wife Ingibiorg in his arms, and
escaped through the smoke. Rögnvald, believing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>Thorfinn had perished, took possession of the Islands.
Thorfinn, who had got secretly over to his dominions in
Caithness, returned shortly afterwards, and surprising
Rögnvald in a house on Papa Stronsay, burnt the house and
all who were in it, except Rögnvald, who sprang over the
heads of the men who surrounded him, and got away in the
darkness. He concealed himself among the rocks by the
shore, but was discovered by the barking of his dog, and
slain by Thorkel Fóstri. Thus Thorfinn was again sole ruler
of the Orkney earldom, as well as that of Caithness. He
went to Norway to make his peace with King Magnus, who
was foster-brother to Earl Rögnvald, and therefore would seek
vengeance for his death. At that time Magnus was at war
with Swein Ulfson, King of Denmark. While he lay with
his fleet at Seley two war-ships rowed up to the king’s
vessel, and a man in a white cloak went straight aboard, and
up to the quarter-deck, where the king sat at meat. Saluting
the king, the man reached forth his hand, took a loaf from
the table, broke it, and ate of it. The king handed the cup
to him when he saw that he had broken bread at his table,
and then he learned that it was Earl Thorfinn, who, having
broken his bread and drunk from his cup, was, for the present
at least, safe from his vengeance, according to the ancient
laws of hospitality. He deemed it wise, however, to take his
departure without having obtained a formal reconciliation.
King Magnus died shortly afterwards, and was succeeded by
his uncle Harald Hardradi. Thorfinn again went to Norway
on hearing of King Magnus’ death, and effected a reconciliation
with King Harald, so that he was now established in the
earldom of Orkney by consent of the over-lord, the King of
Norway.</p>

<p class='c008'>From Norway he went to Denmark, visiting King Swein
at Aalborg, and proceeded thence through Germany on a
pilgrimage to Rome, where he obtained absolution for all
his deeds. After his return from Rome it is said that he
turned his mind more to the government of his dominions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiii'>xxxiii</span>and the welfare of his people than he had previously done in
his career of conquest. He built Christ’s Kirk in Birsay,
and established there the first bishop’s see in the Orkneys.
He died in 1064, having been Earl, by the Saga account, for
“seventy winters,” and the most powerful and wide-landed
of all the Earls of the Orkneys. After his death, as the Saga
states, his widow Ingibiorg was married to King Malcolm
Canmore,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c017'><sup>[32]</sup></a> and became the mother of Duncan, whom, however,
the Scottish historians have always represented as a bastard.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorfinn was succeeded by his two sons, Paul and Erlend,
who were with King Harald Hardradi in his unfortunate
expedition to England. After the battle of Stamford Bridge,
in which King Harald fell, the Orkney earls were allowed to
go home by the victorious Harold Godwinson, and they ruled
their dominions jointly in great harmony till their sons grew
up to manhood, when there began to be discord between the
families. Hakon, the son of Paul, was of a turbulent and
overbearing disposition. He seems to have had a lingering
attachment to the Pagan faith of his forefathers, for, while in
Sweden (which was longer in being converted to Christianity
than Norway), he is said to have sought out the Pagan spaemen
to learn his future from them. Coming to Norway he
tried hard to induce King Magnus Barelegs to undertake an
expedition to the Orkneys and the Western Isles, hoping that
the king would conquer the Islands for the glory of the
conquest, and hand them over to him, as Harald Harfagri
had given them to Rögnvald, Earl of Mœri. He was more
successful than he anticipated. King Magnus, fired with the
love of conquest, did make the expedition, but he deposed
Paul and Erlend, and carried them to Norway, placing his
own son Sigurd, a mere child, over the Orkneys.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the Saga speaks as if there had been only one
expedition by King Magnus to Scotland, there were in reality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxiv'>xxxiv</span>three. Fordun<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c017'><sup>[33]</sup></a> states that when Donald Bane, Duncan, and
Edgar, were struggling for the kingdom on the death of
Malcolm in 1093, King Magnus was ravaging the gulfs of the
Scottish seaboard, and it is stated in the Saga<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c017'><sup>[34]</sup></a> that he
assisted Murcertach in the capture of Dublin in 1094. In
his second expedition in 1098 he carried off the Earls Paul
and Erlend, and made his own son Sigurd Earl of Orkney.
Munch surmises that the motives of this expedition were two-fold—to
secure his power in the Orkneys, and to assist his
protégé Donald Bane, who had again usurped the crown of
Scotland on the death of Duncan in 1095, and was in 1097
hard pressed by Edgar with an English army. King Magnus
took with him from the Orkneys Magnus Erlend’s son (afterwards
St. Magnus), and proceeded southwards to the Hebrides,
where he ravaged Lewis, Skye, Uist, Tiree, and Mull, sparing
Iona on account of its sanctity. The Saga says that he
opened the door of the little church of Columbkill (St. Oran’s
chapel), and was about to enter, but stopped suddenly, closed
the door, forbade any one to enter, and gave the inhabitants
peace. Then he went on to Isla and Kintyre, and thence to
Man and Anglesea, where he fought the battle with the two
Hughs, Earls of Chester and Shrewsbury. On his return
northward he caused his vessel to be drawn across the isthmus
of Tarbert, in imitation of the fabulous sea-king Beite, of whom
a similar story is told. He returned to Norway in 1099, and
during the next two years was occupied with the Swedish
war. In 1102 he returned to the west, married his son Sigurd
to Biadmynia, the daughter of Murcertach, and fell in a
skirmish with the Irish in Ulster in 1103. He was buried in
St. Patrick’s church in Down.<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c017'><sup>[35]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Sigurd, the son of King Magnus, remained Earl of the
Orkneys until his father’s death, when he succeeded to the
throne of Norway.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hakon Paul’s son, and Magnus Erlend’s son, then succeeded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxv'>xxxv</span>to the earldom, and held it jointly until Magnus was
murdered in Egilsey by Hakon on the 16th April, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1115.<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c017'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>After the murder of Magnus, Hakon became sole earl.
He went on a pilgrimage to Rome and the Holy Land, and after
his return became a good ruler, and was so popular “that the
Orkneymen desired no other rulers than Hakon and his issue.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Hakon left two sons, Harald and Paul (the silent).
Harald, who had succeeded to the earldom of Caithness,
which “he held from the King of Scots,” was in some way
unintentionally put to death by his mother Helga and her
sister Frákork. As the Saga tells the story, he met his death
by insisting on putting on a poisoned shirt which the sisters
intended for his half-brother Paul, who, on Harald’s death,
became sole Earl of the Orkneys.</p>

<p class='c008'>A new claimant arose, however, in the person of Kali,
son of Kol, a nobleman resident at Agdir, in Norway, who had
married a sister of Earl Magnus the saint. Kali received
from King Sigurd the gift of half the Orkneys, which had
belonged to his uncle Magnus, and his name was changed
from Kali Kolson to Rögnvald, because his mother said that
Rögnvald     Brusison was the most accomplished of all the Earls of
Orkney, and thought the name would bring her son good fortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rögnvald had many romantic adventures in the prosecution
of his attempt to obtain possession of half of the earldom held by
Paul, which are detailed at length in the Saga. At last he was
advised by his father Kol to make a vow to St. Magnus, that if he
should succeed in establishing himself in the Orkneys he would
build and endow a “stone minster” at Kirkwall, dedicated to St.
Magnus, “to whom the half of the earldom rightly belonged.”
The vow was made, and Rögnvald’s next expedition was successful.
He landed in Shetland, and by a dexterous stratagem
the beacons on Fair Isle and in the Orkneys were made to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvi'>xxxvi</span>give a false alarm of his descent upon the Orkneys, so that
when he did land there he was unopposed. Then he secured
the intervention of the bishop, and an agreement that he
should have half the Islands was concluded between him and
Earl Paul. Shortly thereafter Earl Paul was captured by
Swein Asleifson, a notable leader at that time in the Islands,
and the last and greatest of the Orkney vikings. Swein
carried the earl off in his vessel, and, landing him on the
southern shore of the Moray Firth, delivered him into the safe
keeping of Maddad, Earl of Athole,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c017'><sup>[37]</sup></a> who was married to
Margaret, a sister of Earl Paul. What became of the earl is
not known, “but this,” says the Saga, “is well known, that
he came never again to the Orkneys, and had no dominions
in Scotland.” Swein Asleifson returned to Orkney, and by
the joint consent of Earl Rögnvald, Bishop William of Orkney,
and Bishop John of  Athole, Harald, the son of Maddad, earl
of Athole, was made Earl, along with Rögnvald, though he
was at that time a child of only five years old. This arrangement
was afterwards confirmed by a meeting, held in Caithness,
of the Bœndr and chiefs of the Orkneys and Caithness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earls Rögnvald and Harald visited King Ingi by
invitation at Bergen, and there Earl Rögnvald met with
Eindridi Ungi, a returned Crusader, and became possessed by
a strong desire to visit the Holy Land. On his return voyage
to Orkney, Earl Rögnvald was shipwrecked at Gulberwick in
Shetland, and narrowly escaped with his life. Bishop William
strongly approved of his project to go on a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land, and agreed to accompany him. Accordingly he
went back to Norway to organise the expedition, and returned
to the Orkneys followed by a large number of Jorsala-farers—mostly
adventurers of very indifferent character, if we are to
judge by their turbulent and lawless behaviour during their
stay in the Orkneys, where they spent the winter previous to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxvii'>xxxvii</span>their departure for the East. Early in the spring of the year
1152 Earl Rögnvald called a Thing-meeting of the inhabitants
of the Islands, and told them of his purposed voyage, announcing
that he was to leave the sole government in the hands of
Harald during his absence, and asking them all to obey him
and help him faithfully as their lawful lord. The summer
was far advanced before he sailed, but he had a prosperous
voyage, the adventures of which are detailed in the Saga;
and after visiting Jerusalem and bathing in the Jordan, he
returned by way of Constantinople, Durazzo, Apulia, and
Rome, and so overland to Norway, the whole expedition
occupying about three years.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same summer that Earl Rögnvald left the Orkneys
on his pilgrimage, King Eystein came from Norway with a
large force, and seizing Earl Harald Maddadson as he lay at
Thurso with a single ship, made him pay a ransom of three
marks of gold, and swear fealty to him for Orkney and Shetland.
Earl Maddad of Athole was now dead, and Margaret,
the mother of Earl Harald, had come to the Orkneys. Erlend,
the son of the Earl Harald (Slettmali), who was killed by the
poisoned shirt, had set up his claim to half the earldom after
Rögnvald’s departure. His cause was favoured by King
Eystein, and espoused by Swein Asleifson, and Earl Harald
was obliged to make peace by taking oath to allow Erlend to
remain in possession of the Islands, an arrangement which
was afterwards confirmed by a Thing-meeting of the Bœndr
of the Orkneys, Earl Rögnvald’s claim to his share of the
Islands being, however, reserved. Earl Harald (Maddadson)
was thus denuded of all power in the Islands. He fled across
to Caithness, but after a time he returned to the Orkneys
with four ships and a hundred men, and after an unsuccessful
attempt to surprise Erlend<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c017'><sup>[38]</sup></a> he was obliged to abandon the
enterprise for a time. Meanwhile, Erlend had carried off
Harald’s mother Margaret (who seems to have been still a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxviii'>xxxviii</span>beautiful woman, though of very indifferent character), and
fled with her to the island of Mousa in Shetland, where they
fortified themselves in the old Pictish tower or borg of Mousa,
which about two centuries before had given shelter during a
whole winter to a pair of lovers from Norway, under circumstances
somewhat similar.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c017'><sup>[39]</sup></a> Harald pursued them, and laid
siege to the borg, which could not be taken by assault, but
the two earls came to a mutual understanding, and the siege
was abandoned. Erlend married Margaret, and the same
summer he and Harald went each on a visit to Norway to
meet Earl Rögnvald on his return from the Holy Land.</p>

<p class='c008'>Erlend succeeded in making an alliance with Earl Rögnvald.
Earl Harald was not aware of this till he returned
from Norway, and heard the news in Orkney. He and
Rögnvald met at Thurso, and a skirmish took place between
their respective followers, in which thirteen of Rögnvald’s
men were slain, but by the efforts of their mutual friends the
two earls were brought to an agreement of peace. Erlend
and his faithful ally Swein Asleifson surprised the squadron
of the two earls at Scapa, taking fourteen ships, and putting
both the earls to flight. They crossed over to Caithness
during the night, each in a separate boat, and returning
some time after with a fresh force, they surprised Erlend in
Damsey, and slew him. Then they made peace with
Erlend’s old ally, Swein Asleifson, although this was not
effected without some difficulty. Harald and Rögnvald then
ruled the two earldoms jointly, and apparently in great
harmony, until the death of the latter in 1158. Rögnvald
was slain at Calder, in Caithness, by Thorbiörn Klerk, the
former friend and counsellor of Earl Harald, who had been
made an outlaw by Earl Rögnvald for a murder committed
in Kirkwall, following on a series of acts of violence.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c017'><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxix'>xxxix</span>Earl Harald Maddadson now became sole ruler of the
earldoms of Orkney and Caithness. But by his second
marriage he had allied himself with Hoarflad (Gormlath),
daughter of Malcolm MacHeth, the so-called Earl of Moray,
ex-bishop Wimund, and pretender to the Scottish throne,
and consequently there could be no pacific relations between
him and King William the Lion. The events of this period
are somewhat confusedly told in the chronicles, but it seems
probable that Harald was one of the six earls who rebelled
against King Malcolm in 1160, in order to place William of
Egremont, grandson of Duncan, on the throne,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c017'><sup>[41]</sup></a> and that he
also supported Donaldbane, the son of William who aspired
to the throne, and from 1180 maintained himself in Moray
and Ross, till he was slain at the battle of Macgarvey, 1187.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c017'><sup>[42]</sup></a>
When Harald Ungi, son of Eirik Slagbrellir, by Ingigerd (or
Ingirid), daughter of Earl Rögnvald, appeared as a rival
claimant to the earldom of Orkney, having received from
King Magnus Erlingson a grant of his grandfather’s share of
the Islands, King William embraced his interests, and gave
him a grant of half of Caithness, which was thus taken from
Earl Harald. Then Earl Harald became involved in difficulties
with his other suzerain, the reigning King of Norway,
through the expedition of the Eyarskeggiar or partisans of
Sigurd, son of Magnus Erlingson, whom they endeavoured
to place upon the throne in opposition to King Sverrir.
Sigurd’s cause was largely espoused by the Orkneymen, and
the expedition (which was organised and fitted out in Orkney)
did much mischief in Norway. Earl Harald was obliged to
present himself before King Sverrir in Bergen. He went
from Orkney accompanied by Bishop Bjarni. In presence of
a great assembly in the Christ’s Kirk garth, the earl confessed
his fault, saying that he was now an old man, as his beard
bore witness; that he had bent the knee before many kings,
sometimes in closest friendship, but oftener in circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xl'>xl</span>of misfortune; that he had not been unfaithful to his
allegiance, although some of his people might have done that
which was contrary to the king’s interests; and that he had
not been always able to rule the Orkneys entirely according
to his own will; and that now he came to yield up himself
and all his possessions into the king’s power. So saying, he
advanced, and casting himself to the earth, he laid his head at
King Sverrir’s feet. The king granted him pardon, but took
from him the whole of Shetland,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c017'><sup>[43]</sup></a> “which never after that
formed part of the Norwegian earldom of Orkney,” though
after the time of the Saga-writer, Shetland as well as Orkney
was granted to Henry St. Clair in 1379 by King Hakon
Magnusson, the second of that name.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yet though humiliated in this manner, and stripped of a
great part of his dominions, Earl Harald, according to Hoveden,
dared to contest the possession of Moray with King
William, instigated no doubt by his wife, in whose right
alone he could have had any feasible claim to its possession.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roger de Hoveden, chaplain to Henry II., a contemporary
chronicler, thus records the events that followed:—<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c017'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>“In the same year (1196) William, King of Scots, having
gathered a great army, entered Moray to drive out Harald
MacMadit, who had occupied that district. But before the
king could enter Caithness, Harald fled to his ships, not
wishing to risk a battle with the king. Then the King of
Scots sent his army to Turseha (Thurso), the town of the
aforesaid Harald, and destroyed his castle there. But Harald,
seeing that the king would completely devastate the country,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xli'>xli</span>came to the king’s feet and placed himself at his mercy,
chiefly because of a raging tempest in the sea, and the wind
being contrary, so that he could not go to the Orkneys; and
he promised the king that he would bring to him all his
enemies when the king should again return to Moray. On
that condition the king permitted him to retain a half of
Caithness, and the other half he gave to Harald, the younger,
grandson of Reginald (Rögnvald), a former Earl of Orkney and
Caithness. Then the king returned to his own land, and
Harald to the Orkneys. The king returned in the autumn
to Moray, as far as Ilvernarran (Invernairn), in order to
receive the king’s enemies from Harald. But though Harald
had brought them as far as the port of Lochloy near Invernairn,
he allowed them to escape; and when the king returned
late from hunting, Harald came to him, bringing with him
two boys, his grandchildren, to deliver them to the king as
hostages. Being asked by the king where were the king’s
enemies whom he had promised to deliver up, and where was
Thorfinn his son, whom he had also promised to give as a
hostage, he replied, ‘I allowed them to escape, knowing that
if I delivered them up to you they would not escape out of
your hands. My son I could not bring, for there is no other
heir to my lands.’ So, because he had not kept the agreement
which he had made with the king, he was adjudged to remain
in the king’s custody until his son should arrive and become
a hostage for him. And because he had permitted the king’s
enemies to escape, he was also adjudged to have forfeited
those lands which he held of the king. The king took Harald
with him to Edinburgh Castle, and laid him in chains until
his men brought his son Thorfinn from the Orkneys; and on
their delivering him up as a hostage to the king, Harald was
liberated.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So Harald returned to Orkney, and there remained in
peace and quiet, until Harald the younger, having received a
grant of the half of the Orkneys from Sverrir Birkebein, the
King of Norway, joined himself to Sigurd Murt, and many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlii'>xlii</span>other warriors, and invaded Orkney. Harald the elder, being
unwilling to engage with him in battle, left the Orkneys and
fled to the Isle of Man. He was followed by Harald the
younger, but Harald the elder had left Man before his arrival
there, and gone by another way to the Orkneys with his fleet,
and there he killed all the adherents of the younger Harald
whom he found in the Islands. Harald the younger returned
to Caithness to Wick, where he engaged in battle with Harald
the elder, and in that battle Harald the younger and all his
army were slain. Harald the elder then went to the King of
Scots, on the safe conduct of Roger and Reginald, the bishops
of St. Andrews and Rosemarkie, and took to the king a large
sum in gold and silver for the redemption of his lands of
Caithness. The king said he would give him back Caithness
if he would put away his wife (Gormlath), the daughter of
Malcolm MacHeth, and take back his first wife, Afreka, the
sister of Duncan, Earl of Fife, and deliver up to him as a
hostage Laurentius his priest,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c017'><sup>[45]</sup></a> and Honaver the son of Ingemund,
as hostages. But this Harald was unwilling to do;
therefore came Reginald, son of Sumarlid, King of Man and
the Isles, to William, King of Scots, and purchased from him
Caithness, saving the king’s annual tribute.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Reginald, being supplied with auxiliary forces from Ireland
by his brother-in-law, John of Courcy, overran Caithness,
and, returning home, left the conquered earldom in charge of
three deputies. Harald procured the murder of one of them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliii'>xliii</span>and then, coming over from Orkney with a strong force,
landed at Scrabster, where the bishop met him and endeavoured
to mollify him. But Harald had a special grudge
against Bishop John, which added to his rage at what he considered
the defection of his Caithness subjects. The bishop
had refused to collect from the people of Caithness a tax of
one penny annually from each inhabited house, which Earl
Harald had some years previously granted to the papal
revenues. Accordingly he stormed the “borg” at Scrabster,
in which the bishop and the principal men of the district had
taken refuge, slew almost all that were in it, and caused the
bishop to be blinded and his tongue to be cut out.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c017'><sup>[46]</sup></a> The two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xliv'>xliv</span>remaining deputies of King Reginald fled to the King of Scots,
whose first act was to take revenge on Harald’s son Thorfinn.
He was blinded and castrated after the barbarous manner of
the times, and died miserably in the dungeon of Roxburgh
Castle. King William, then collecting a great army, marched
north to Eysteinsdal on the borders of Caithness in the spring
of 1202. Though Harald had collected a force of 6000 men,
he felt himself unable to cope with the king, and was obliged
to sue for peace, which was obtained on the hard condition of
the payment of every fourth penny to be found in Caithness,
amounting to 2000 marks of silver.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Harald’s career was now drawing to a close. He
died in 1206, at the advanced age of seventy-three, having
had the earldom for twenty years jointly with Earl Rögnvald,
and forty-eight years after Rögnvald’s death.</p>

<p class='c008'>His sons John and David succeeded him, and ruled jointly
for seven years, when David died and John became sole Earl
of Orkney and Caithness. The most notable event of his time
was the burning of Bishop Adam at Halkirk in Caithness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bishop Adam was a man of low birth. According to the
Saga he was a foundling, and had been exposed at a church
door. Previous to his consecration to the see of Caithness,
in 1214, he had been Abbot of Melrose.<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c017'><sup>[47]</sup></a> He arbitrarily
increased the exaction of the bishop’s seat to such an extent
that the populace rose in a body, and proceeding tumultuously
to Halkirk, where he was residing, demanded abatement of the
unjust exactions. Earl John, who was in the neighbourhood
at the time, declined to interfere, and the exasperated populace,
finding the bishop indisposed to treat them more liberally, first
killed his adviser, Serlo, a monk of Newbottle, and then burnt
the bishop. In the quaint language of Wyntoun—</p>

<p class='c021'>The Saga tells that when the tidings of this outrage
reached King Alexander he was greatly enraged, and that
the terrible vengeance he took was still fresh in memory
when the Saga was written. Fordun states that the king
had the perpetrators of this deed mangled in limb and
racked with many a torture. The Icelandic Annals are more
precise. They say that he caused the hands and feet to be
hewn from eighty of the men who had been present at the
burning, and that many of them died in consequence.</p>

<p class='c008'>With this tragic and ill-omened event the chequered
history of the line of the Norse Earls draws to a close. Earl
John sought to clear himself from the guilt of complicity in
the murder of the bishop by the testimony of “good men”
that he had no hand in it; but seeing that he had neither
assisted the bishop nor sought to punish his murderers, he
was heavily fined by King Alexander, and deprived of part
of his Scottish earldom. Subsequently he had an interview
with the king at Forfar, and bought back his lands. In the
summer of 1224 he was summoned by King Hakon to
Norway, having fallen under suspicion of a desire to aid the
designs of Earl Skule against Hakon’s power in Norway;
and after a conference with the king at Bergen he returned
to Orkney, leaving his only son Harald behind him as a
hostage. In 1226 Harald was drowned at sea, probably on
his passage home from Norway. In 1231, Earl John having
become involved in a feud with Hanef Ungi, a commissioner
whom King Hakon had sent over to the Orkneys, Snækoll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvi'>xlvi</span>Gunnason, grandson of Earl Rögnvald (Kali Kolson), and
Aulver Illteit, they attacked him suddenly in an inn at
Thurso, set fire to the house, and slew him in the cellar,
where he had sought to conceal himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the ancient line of the Norse Earls, that had ruled
the Orkneys since 872—a period of 350 years—became
extinct, and the earldom passed into the possession of the
house of Angus.</p>
<h3 id='h3-V' class='c016'>V. <span class='sc'>The Earldom in the Angus Line</span>—1231-1312.</h3>
<p class='c007'>On the failure of the line of the Norse Earls by the death
of Earl John in 1231, King Alexander II. of Scotland, in
1232, granted the earldom of North Caithness to Magnus,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c017'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
the second son of Gilbride, Earl of Angus. Sutherland, or
the southern land of Caithness, was now made a separate
earldom, and given to William, son of Hugh Freskyn, who
was thus the first of the Earls of Sutherland.</p>
<p class='c008'>Magnus seems to have been confirmed in the earldom of
Orkney by the King of Norway; but from this time the
notices of Orkney and its earls in the Icelandic or Norwegian
records are so few and obscure, that but little is to be
gathered from them. The Iceland Annals, however, record
the death of Magnus, Earl of Orkney, in 1239.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Diploma of Bishop Thomas Tulloch, drawn up
<i>circa</i> 1443,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c017'><sup>[49]</sup></a> it is stated that this Magnus was succeeded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlvii'>xlvii</span>Earl Gilbride, to whom succeeded Gilbride his son, who held
both the earldoms of Orkney and Caithness in Scotland. The
Annals only notice one Gilbride, whom they call “Gibbon,
Earl of Orkney.” His death is placed in the year 1256.</p>

<p class='c008'>According to the Diploma, Gilbride had one son, Magnus,
and a daughter, Matilda. This Magnus is mentioned in the
Saga of Hakon Hakonson as accompanying the ill-fated
expedition of that monarch against Scotland in 1263. “With
King Hakon from Bergen went Magnus, Earl of Orkney, and
the king gave him a good long-ship.” Pilots had previously
been procured from the Orkneys, and the fleet, after being
two nights at sea with a gentle wind, put into Bressay Sound
in Shetland, where they remained nearly half a month.
Then they sailed for the Orkneys, and lay for some time in
Elwick Bay, opposite Inganess, near Kirkwall. Then they
moved round South Ronaldsay, and lay some time in Ronaldsvoe,
while men were sent over to Caithness to levy a
contribution from the inhabitants,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c017'><sup>[50]</sup></a> of which the scald sings
that “he imposed tribute on the dwellers on the Ness, who
were terrified by the steel-clad exactor of rings.” Ordering
the Orkneymen to follow him as soon as they were ready,
the king sailed south to Lewis and Skye, where he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlviii'>xlviii</span>joined by Magnus, King of Man. The fleet, which now
consisted of more than a hundred vessels, for the most part
large and all well equipped, was divided into two squadrons,
one of which, consisting of fifty ships, plundered the coasts
of Kintyre and Mull, rejoining King Hakon at Gigha. A
detached squadron now plundered Bute, and the fleet cast
anchor in Arran Sound, from which King Hakon sent
Gilbert, Bishop of Hamar, and Henry, Bishop of Orkney,
with three other envoys, to treat for peace with the Scottish
King. The negotiations failed, and soon after the fleet was
disabled by a storm, and the power of the Norwegian King
utterly broken in the battle of Largs. King Hakon, gathering
together the shattered remnants of his fleet and army,
retired slowly northwards, meeting with no impediment
until they arrived off Durness, in Sutherlandshire, when the
wind fell calm, and the fleet steered into the sound, where
seven men of a boat’s crew, who had been sent ashore for
water, were killed by the Scots. In passing through the
Pentland Firth one vessel went down with all on board in
the “Swelkie,” a dangerous whirlpool in certain states of the
tide, and another was carried by the current helplessly
through the Firth, and made straight for Norway. King
Hakon laid up his fleet in Midland Harbour and Scapa Bay.
He then rode to Kirkwall, and lay down to die. He was
lodged in the bishop’s palace, and after having been confined
to his bed for some days, he recovered so much that he
attended mass in the bishop’s chapel, and walked to the
cathedral to visit the shrine of St. Magnus. But there came
a relapse, and he was again laid prostrate. He caused the
Bible and Latin books to be read to him to beguile the
tedium of the sick bed, until he was no longer able to bear
the fatigue of reflecting on what he heard; and then he
desired that Norwegian books should be read to him night
and day—first the Sagas of the Saints, and then the
Chronicles of the Kings, from Halfdan the Black through
all the succession of the Kings of Norway. Then he set his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xlix'>xlix</span>affairs in order, caused his silver plate to be weighed out to
pay his troops, and received the sacrament. He died at
midnight on Saturday, 15th December 1263. On Sunday
the corpse, clothed in the richest garments, with a garland on
the head, was laid in state in the upper hall of the palace.
The king’s chamberlains stood round it with tapers, and all
day long the people came to view the remains of their king.
The nobles kept watch over the bier through the night; and
on Monday the royal remains were borne to St. Magnus’
Cathedral, where they lay in state all that night. On
Tuesday they were temporarily interred in the choir of the
church, near the steps leading to the shrine of St. Magnus.
Before his death the king had given directions that his body
should be carried east to Norway, and buried beside the
remains of his father and his relatives in Bergen. In the
month of March the corpse was exhumed and conveyed to
Scapa, where it was placed on board the great ship in which
he had sailed on the unfortunate expedition to Largs, and taken
to Bergen, where it was interred in the choir of Christ’s Church.</p>

<p class='c008'>Magnus Gilbride’s son, who was Earl of Orkney at the
time of King Hakon’s expedition, died (according to the
Annals) in 1273.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was succeeded by a son of the same name. The
Annals have the entry under the year 1276:—“Magnus, King
of Norway, gave to Magnus, son of Earl Magnus of Orkney,
the title of Earl, at Tunsberg.” He appears also as Earl of
Orkney in the document, dated 5th February 1283, declaring
Margaret, the Maiden of Norway, the nearest heir to the
Scottish throne.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c017'><sup>[51]</sup></a> The death of Earl Magnus, Magnus’ son, is
recorded in the year 1284,<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c017'><sup>[52]</sup></a> along with that of Bishop Peter
of Orkney and Sturla the Lawman. The Diploma states that
he died without issue, and was succeeded by his brother John
in the earldom of Orkney and Caithness.</p>

<p class='c008'>John, as Earl of Caithness, appears in 1289 as one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_l'>l</span>signatories to the letter addressed by the nobles to King
Edward of England proposing that the young Prince Edward
should marry Margaret, the Maid of Norway. His name also
occurs in the list of those summoned to attend the first
parliament of Balliol. He swore fealty to King Edward at
Murkle in Caithness, in 1297.</p>

<p class='c008'>King Eirik of Norway in 1281 had married the Scottish
princess Margaret, daughter of Alexander III. She died in
1283, leaving one daughter, Margaret, “the Maid of Norway,”
who became sole heiress to the crown of Scotland, and in
1289 was formally betrothed to Prince Edward of England.
She died at sea off the coast of Orkney,<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c017'><sup>[53]</sup></a> on her way to Scotland,
in September or October 1290. There is no record of
the circumstances of her death,<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c017'><sup>[54]</sup></a> but we learn from a letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_li'>li</span>of Bishop Audfinn of Bergen,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c017'><sup>[55]</sup></a> written twenty years after the
event in connection with the case of the false Margaret, who
was burned at Bergen in 1301 (as will be detailed hereafter),
that her remains were brought back to Bergen in charge of
the Bishop (most probably of the Orkneys) and Herr Thore
Hakonson, whose wife, Ingibiorg Erlingsdatter, was Margaret’s
attendant on the voyage. In 1293 Eirik married Isabel, who
is styled in the Iceland Annals “daughter of Sir Robert, son
of Robert, Earl of Brus.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c017'><sup>[56]</sup></a> It appears that on the 24th of
July of that year King Edward gave permission to Robert
Bruce, Earl of Carrick, the father of Isabella Bruce, to go to
Norway,<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c017'><sup>[57]</sup></a> and to remain there for a time; and Munch, the
Norwegian historian, conjectures that he had then brought
over his daughter, and stayed till the marriage took place,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c017'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
and that King Eirik may have hoped by this alliance to bring
the crown of Scotland once more into the possession of a
branch of his own royal line. In 1297 Isabella bore him a
daughter named Ingibiorg. King Eirik died 13th July 1299,
and was succeeded by his brother Hakon (Magnusson).</p>

<p class='c008'>John, Earl of Orkney, seems to have gone to Norway to
take the oath of allegiance to King Hakon immediately after
his accession, for we find in the Icelandic Annals that he
was betrothed to King Eirik’s daughter in 1299. The statement
is explicit, and though it may seem strange to us that
an infant scarcely two years of age should be betrothed to a
man of forty, Munch makes the remark that such unlikely
contracts were by no means so unusual in those days as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lii'>lii</span>oblige us to discredit the statement. In fact, we find this
same King Hakon betrothing his own daughter when an
infant of one year to a man who, though he was much younger
than Earl John, was nevertheless a full-grown man. But Earl
John seems to have died shortly after the betrothal, for we find
that Ingibiorg was betrothed anew in 1311, and John’s successor
in the earldom appears on record in 1312, with Ferquhard,
Bishop of Caithness, witnessing the confirmation by King
Robert I. and Hakon V. (at Inverness, 28th October) of the prior
treaty executed at Perth, 6th July 1266, between King Alexander
III. and Magnus IV. (the son of the unfortunate Hakon),
by which the Kings of Norway ceded for ever the Isle of Man
and all the other islands of the Sudreys, and all the islands in
the west and south of the great Haf, except the isles of Orkney
and Shetland, which were specially reserved to Norway. In
consideration of this the King of Scotland became bound to pay
to the King of Norway and his heirs for ever an annual sum
of 100 marks, within St. Magnus’ church, in addition to a payment
of 4000 marks to be paid within the space of four years.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was about the time of Earl John’s visit to the court of
King Hakon, on the occasion above referred to, that there
occurred in Norway one of the most extraordinary instances
of imposture on record. A woman appeared in Bergen,
in 1300, declaring that she was the princess Margaret,
daughter of King Eirik, and heiress to the crown of Scotland,
who was believed by all in Norway and in Britain to have
died off the coast of Orkney some ten years previously. She
had come over in a ship from Lubeck,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c017'><sup>[59]</sup></a> and her story was that
she had been “sold” or betrayed by her attendant Ingibiorg
Erlingsdatter, in the interest of certain persons who wished
her out of the way, and had falsely given her out for dead.
Although her appearance and circumstances were strongly
against the credibility of her story, it seems to have taken a
strong hold of the popular mind, and not a few of the clergy
and the higher classes, possibly influenced by political
<span class='pageno' id='Page_liii'>liii</span>motives, appear to have given her countenance. She was a
married woman, and was accompanied by her husband, a
German.  She is described by Bishop Audfinn as being
well up in years, her hair was greyish, and partially whitened
with age, and to all appearance she was at least twenty years
older than the date of King Eirik’s marriage with Margaret
of Scotland, and consequently about seven years older than
King Eirik himself, who was but thirteen when he was
married. “Yet,” says Munch, “though the king’s daughter
Margaret had died in the presence of some of the best men
of Norway, though her corpse had been brought back by the
bishop and Herr Thore Hakonson, to King Eirik, who himself
had laid it in the open grave, satisfied himself of the identity
of his daughter’s remains, and placed them in the Christ’s
Kirk by the side of her mother’s;—though this woman, in
short, was a rank impostor, yet she found many among the
great men to believe her story, and not a few of the priests
also gave her their countenance and support. That this
German woman, purely of her own accord, should have
attempted to personate the princess Margaret ten years after
her death, and should have ventured to appear publicly in
Norway on such an enterprise, seems hardly credible. It
is more likely that she may have been persuaded to it by
some parties perceiving in her a certain personal resemblance,
who schooled her in the story she must tell to give her
personation an air of reality.” King Hakon was away from
Bergen, and no action was taken in regard to her case until
he returned in the early part of the winter of 1301. It was
natural that he should wish personally to see and examine
the impostor, and confront her with the princess’s attendants,
especially to hear the testimony of Ingibiorg Erlingsdatter,
before deciding on anything. There is no record of the trial,
but soon after the king’s arrival the “false Margaret” was
burnt at Nordness in Bergen, as an impostor, and her husband
was beheaded. As she was being taken through the Kongsgaard
gate to the place of execution, she is reported to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_liv'>liv</span>said—“I remember well when I as a child was taken
through this self-same gate to be carried to Scotland. There
was then in the High Church of the Apostles an Iceland priest,
Haflidi<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c017'><sup>[60]</sup></a> by name, who was the court priest of my father
King Eirik; and when the clergy ceased singing, then Sir
Haflidi struck up with the ‘Veni Creator,’ and the hymn was
sung out to the end just as I was being taken on board
the ship.” Notwithstanding the manifest nature of the imposture
she was regarded by the multitude as a martyr; a
chapel was erected on the spot where she suffered, and the
number of pilgrimages made to it increased to such an extent
that Bishop Audfinn interfered and forbade them.<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c017'><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Earl John’s successor in the earldom of Orkney and
Caithness was his son Magnus, the fifth of the name, and last
of the Angus line. He first appears on record in 1312 in the
treaty between King Robert Bruce and Hakon Magnusson,
concluded at Inverness. In 1320, as Earl of Caithness and
Orkney, he subscribed the famous letter to the Pope, asserting
the independence of Scotland.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c017'><sup>[62]</sup></a> It seems as if he had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lv'>lv</span>dead in 1321, for in a document addressed by King Robert
Bruce to the “ballivi” of the King of Norway in Orkney, and
dated at Cullen, 4th August 1321, he complains that Alexander
Brun, “the king’s enemy,” convicted of <i>lese majestatis</i>,
had been received into Orkney and had been refused to be
given up, though instantly demanded by “our ballivus in
Caithness, Henry St. Clair.” He was certainly dead in 1329,
for in that year Katharina, as his widow, executes two
charters in her own name as Countess of Orkney and Caithness,
by which she purchases from the Lord High Steward
(Drottset), Herr Erling Vidkunnson, certain lands in Rögnvaldsey,
including the Pentland Skerries.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c017'><sup>[63]</sup></a> In one of these
documents she speaks of Earl John as he from whom her
husband had inherited his possessions which he left to her,
thus corroborating the statement of the Diploma that Magnus
was the son of John.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c017'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<h3 id='h3-VI' class='c016'>VI. <span class='sc'>The Earldom in the Stratherne Line</span>—1321-1379.</h3>
<p class='c007'>The Diploma states that the earldom now passed by
lineal succession to Malise, Earl of Stratherne, Magnus V.
having left no male issue. In 1331 Malise, Earl of Stratherne,
possessed lands in Caithness,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c017'><sup>[65]</sup></a> doubtless in right of his
wife, probably a daughter of Magnus V. Malise fell in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lvi'>lvi</span>battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, and was succeeded by his son,
also named Malise, who became heir to the three earldoms of
Stratherne, Caithness, and Orkney.</p>
<p class='c008'>Malise (the younger) styles himself Earl of Stratherne,
Caithness, and Orkney, in a document dated at Inverness in
1334,<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c017'><sup>[66]</sup></a> in which he grants his daughter Isabella in marriage to
William, Earl of Ross, granting her also the earldom of
Caithness failing heirs male of himself and his wife Marjory.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c017'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>William, Earl of Ross, succeeded his father Hugh, who fell
at Halidon Hill in 1333, but it is stated that he was not
confirmed in the earldom for three years, on account of his
absence in Norway.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c017'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>It seems that Earl Malise must have passed over to
Norway about the same period, in all probability to obtain
formal investiture of the earldom of Orkney from the
Norwegian King Magnus, and William, Earl of Ross, may
have accompanied his father-in-law. There is no record of
Malise’s movements, but we learn incidentally that he had
betaken himself to his northern possessions,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c017'><sup>[69]</sup></a> when he lost the
earldom of Stratherne, which was declared forfeited by King
Edward and given to John de Warrenne, Earl of Surrey. It
is stated that Malise, apparently seeking to preserve the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lvii'>lvii</span>earldom in a branch of his own family, gave one of his
daughters in marriage to John de Warrenne, and that King
David then declared the earldom forfeited,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c017'><sup>[70]</sup></a> and bestowed it on
his nephew, Maurice de Moravia,<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c017'><sup>[71]</sup></a> son of Sir John de Moravia
of Abercairny, who had married Malise’s sister Mary.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c017'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Malise appears to have made an effort to recover the
earldom of Stratherne in 1334. In that year King Edward,
by a letter dated 2d March, directed Henry de Beaumont,
Earl of Boghan, not to allow any process to be made before
him respecting the earldom of Stratherne forfeited for treason
by Earl Malise. He also wrote a letter of the same date to
Edward Balliol, stating that he has heard that Malise, Earl of
Stratherne, claims the county of Stratherne, which he had
granted to John de Warrenne, Earl of Surrey, and requesting
Balliol to act with deliberation.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c017'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The Diploma states that Malise was first married to
Johanna, daughter of Sir John Menteith, and that by her he had
a daughter Matilda, married to Wayland de Ard. But there
is a record of a confirmation by Robert I. (1306-1329) of a
grant of the lands of Carcathie (Cortachy) in Forfarshire, and
half of Urkwell in the earldom of Stratherne, by Malise,
Earl of Stratherne, to his wife Johanna, daughter of the late
John de Monteith.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c017'><sup>[74]</sup></a> As Malise the younger only became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lviii'>lviii</span>Earl of Stratherne on the death of his father in 1333, if the
confirmation be correctly ascribed to Robert I., this must
refer to the Malise who was earl previous to 1333, and who
had a daughter Matilda contracted to Robert de Thony in
1293, “being not yet in her 20th year.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c017'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The Diploma further states that Malise (the younger) was
married the second time to a daughter of Hugh, Earl of Ross,
consequently a sister of William, Earl of Ross, who married
Malise’s daughter Isabella. From the deed of 1334 we learn
that Malise’s wife’s name was Marjory. In a deed of 1350
we find William, Earl of Ross, styling his sister Marjory
Countess of Caithness and Orkney,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c017'><sup>[76]</sup></a> and with her consent
appointing his brother Hugh his heir in the event of his own
death without male issue. From this it would appear that
Malise was then dead. He must have been dead before
1353, when his son-in-law, Erngils Suneson, obtained the title
of Earl of Orkney from the King of Norway. He is mentioned
as dead in 1357 and 1358,<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c017'><sup>[77]</sup></a> and the Earl of Ross is
then said to have entered to his lands in Caithness, doubtless
in right of his wife Isabella, and in terms of that deed of
1334 previously noticed.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c017'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_lix'>lix</span>While Malise was in Norway and Sweden two of his
daughters had been married to Swedish noblemen—one to
Arngils<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c017'><sup>[79]</sup></a> or Erngisl, son of Sune Jonsson, and another to
Guttorm Sperra.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c017'><sup>[80]</sup></a> On the death of Malise, or shortly thereafter,
Erngisl Suneson claimed his wife’s share of the earldom.
In the year 1353 we find him executing a deed on the 10th
April as plain Erngisl Suneson, and on the 6th May thereafter
his signature appears to a document drawn up at
Vagahuus concerning the queen’s dowry, occupying the foremost
place among the nobles of Norway, and with the title
of Earl of Orkney.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c017'><sup>[81]</sup></a> Although the Diploma states that he
held only his wife’s share of the earldom, it is plain from this
document that he must have received the title of Earl of the
Orkneys from the King of Norway. He soon became
involved with the Swedish party in favour of King Eirik of
Pomern, and in 1357 King Magnus sequestrated his estates
in Norway, and declared his title forfeited. His right to the
earldom would have lapsed with the death of his wife, who
died childless before 1360.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c017'><sup>[82]</sup></a> Nevertheless he continued to
style himself Earl of Orkney during his lifetime.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c017'><sup>[83]</sup></a> He died
in 1392.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the sequestration of Erngisl’s rights by the king, a
certain Duncan Anderson, who appears to have been a
Scotchman, and probably agent for Alexander de Ard, the
son of Matilda, called the eldest daughter of Malise, issued a
manifesto, notifying to the inhabitants of Orkney that he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lx'>lx</span>the true and legitimate heir of Earl Malise, the former Earl
of Orkney, under his guardianship; that this heir has now
the full and undeniable right to the earldom; and that, as
he has heard that the King of Norway has recently sequestrated
the revenues of the earldom, he warns the inhabitants
not to allow these revenues to be taken furth of the land till
the true heir be presented to them, which will be ere very
long, if the Lord will. The inhabitants, who seem to have
been somewhat disquieted by the missive, sent a representation
on the subject to the court of Norway. It would seem
that a representation must have been made by the court of
Norway to the Scottish King regarding the troubling of the
islands by the claimants or their friends in Scotland, for
an edict was issued by King David from Scone, in 1367,
forbidding any of his subjects, of whatever rank or condition,
to pass into Orkney, or frequent its harbours, on any other
errand than that of lawful commerce.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1375, King Hakon of Norway granted the earldom of
Orkney for a single year till next St. John’s Day to Alexander
de Ard,<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c017'><sup>[84]</sup></a> naming him, however, in the document not as Earl
but simply as Governor and Commissioner for the King, and
declaring, in the document addressed to the Islanders, that
this grant is given provisionally until the said Alexander shall
establish his claim to the earldom. He seems not to have
been regarded with much favour by the king, for this grant
was not renewed, and in 1379 Henry St. Clair and Malise
Sparre preferred their claims to the earldom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Alexander de Ard had succeeded to the earldom of Caithness
by the law and custom of Scotland, in right of his mother
as heir to Earl Malise. In 1375 he resigned the castle of
Brathwell (Brawl), and all the lands in Caithness or any other
part of Scotland which he inherited in right of his mother,
Matilda de Stratherne, to King Robert II., who bestowed them
on his own son, David Stewart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl David Stewart appears in 1377-78 as Earl Palatine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxi'>lxi</span>of Stratherne and Caithness. King Robert III. gave the earldom
of Caithness to his brother, Walter Stewart, of Brechin,
who held it till about 1424. He then resigned it to his son
Alan, who was slain at Inverlochy in 1431. The earldom
reverted to his father, who in 1437 was forfeited for his share
in the murder of King James I. The earldom remained in
possession of the crown till 1452, when it was granted by
King James II. to Sir George Crichtoun, Admiral of Scotland.
On his death in 1455 King James granted the earldom of
Caithness to William St. Clair, then Earl of Orkney, in whose
line it has continued till the present day.</p>
<h3 id='h3-VII' class='c016'>VII. <span class='sc'>The Earldom in the Line of St. Clair</span>—1379-1469.</h3>
<p class='c007'>The genealogical questions connected with the succession of
the St. Clairs of Roslin to the earldom of Orkney are involved
in apparently inextricable confusion.</p>
<p class='c008'>So early as 1321 we find a Henry St. Clair acting as the
“ballivus” of King Robert Bruce in Caithness,<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c017'><sup>[85]</sup></a> and in 1364
we also find a Thomas St. Clair installed at Kirkwall as the
“ballivus” of the King of Norway, an Alexander St. Clair,
and a Euphemia de Stratherne, styling herself one of the heirs
of the late Malise, Earl of Stratherne.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c017'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The Diploma states explicitly that one of the four daughters
of Malise, Earl of Stratherne,<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c017'><sup>[87]</sup></a> by his wife Marjory,
daughter of Hugh, Earl of Ross, was married to William St.
Clair. This must be William St. Clair, son of the Sir William
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxii'>lxii</span>St. Clair who fell with the Douglas in Spain fighting against
the Saracens in 1330.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c017'><sup>[88]</sup></a> The Diploma goes on to narrate that
Henry St. Clair, the son of William St. Clair and this daughter
of Malise, succeeded to the earldom of Orkney apparently in
right of his mother. We know from the deed of investiture
that his accession to the earldom took place in 1379.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a charter of 1391 Earl Henry names his mother
Isabella St. Clair. It is usually said that his father, William
St. Clair, married Isabella, daughter of Malise, Earl of Stratherne.
But, as we have seen from the deed of 1334, Isabella
was married to William, Earl of Ross, not to William, Earl of
Roslin. Yet it appears from the deed of 1391 that Henry’s
mother’s name was Isabella, and though he does not style her
a daughter of Malise, the terms of the document imply that
she was heiress to lands in Orkney and Shetland. The
Diploma only mentions one of the Earls Malise, and it may be
that the Isabella whom William St. Clair married was the daughter
of the elder and sister of the younger Malise of Stratherne.</p>

<p class='c008'>If he had married one of the four daughters of the
younger Malise it seems unaccountable why he did not
claim his wife’s portion of the earldom. We find that the
representatives of the other sisters were claimants, and that
one of them, Erngisl Suneson, actually received his wife’s
share, and enjoyed the title of Earl of Orkney, while Alexander
de Ard is said to have succeeded to the earldom of
Caithness in virtue of a similar claim, and had his rights to
the earldom of Orkney so far recognised by the King of
Norway on the forfeiture of Erngisl Suneson. The Earl of
Ross, as we have seen, also succeeded to the share falling to
his wife Isabella. But no claim seems to have been made for
the Isabella who is said to have been married to William St.
Clair. If she had been a daughter of the younger Malise it
can scarcely be doubted that such a claim would have been
made, and if made, established as readily as that of the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxiii'>lxiii</span>sisters. William St. Clair was alive in 1358, five years after
the claim of the sister married to Erngisl Suneson had been
made good, and one year after Erngisl’s title to the earldom
had been declared forfeited.</p>

<p class='c008'>But a more fatal objection to the statement of the Diploma,
that William’s wife was a daughter of the younger Malise,
arises from the fact that in the attestation by the Lawman
and Canons of Orkney in favour of James of Cragy (1422) it
is expressly certified that Henry Sinclair was himself married
to a daughter of the younger Malise, styled “Elizabeth de
Stratherne, daughter of the late reverend and venerable
Malise, Earl of Orkney,” and that by her he had a daughter,
Margaret, who was married to James of Cragy. The Diploma,
on the other hand, states that Henry was married to Janet
Haliburton, daughter of Walter Haliburton of Dirleton, and
by her had a son Henry, who succeeded him. It is quite
possible, however, that both these statements might be true,
the attestation in favour of James of Cragy having no reason
to mention the second wife, and the Diploma having no
special reason to mention the first wife in connection with the
succession which it derives through the mother, making her,
moreover, such a remarkable instance of longevity that she
survived her husband, her son, and all her younger sisters,
and all their sons and daughters, and became sole heiress to
the earldom after Earl Henry’s death, although he left a son
who ought to have succeeded him, but who, according to the
Diploma, succeeded to her, his grandmother.</p>

<p class='c008'>In whatever way these apparently contradictory statements
are to be reconciled, the statement of the Diploma
that Henry St. Clair was the first of the line who enjoyed the
title of Earl of Orkney is undoubtedly borne out by the
records. In the summer of 1379 he passed over to Norway
and received formal investiture from King Hakon of the
earldom of Orkney and also of the lordship of Shetland,<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c017'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxiv'>lxiv</span>which, since the time of its forfeiture to King Sverrir by Earl
Harald Maddadson, had been in the possession of the crown
of Norway. The conditions on which he accepted the earldom
are set forth at length in the deed of investiture, and contrasting
them with the semi-independence of the ancient earls
a recent writer has remarked that they left him little more than
the lands of his fathers.<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c017'><sup>[90]</sup></a> Although the Earls of Orkney
had precedence of all the titled nobility of Norway, and
their signatures to the national documents stand always after
the Archbishops, and before the Bishops and nobles, though
the title was the only hereditary one permitted in Norway
to a subject not of the blood royal, yet it was now declared
to be subject to the royal option of investiture. The earl
was to govern the Islands and enjoy their revenues during
the king’s pleasure, but he was taken bound to serve the
king beyond the bounds of the earldom, with a hundred
men fully equipped, when called on by the king’s message;
he was to build no castle or place of strength in the Islands,
make no war, enter into no agreement with the bishop, nor
sell or impignorate any of his rights, without the king’s express
consent; and moreover he was to be answerable for
his whole administration to the king’s court at Bergen. At
his death the earldom and all the Islands were to revert to
the King of Norway or his heirs, and if the earl left sons
they could not succeed to their father’s dignity and possessions
without the royal investiture. At the following Martinmas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxv'>lxv</span>he was taken bound to pay to the king 1000 English nobles.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c017'><sup>[91]</sup></a>
It was part of the compact also that Malise Sperra, son of
Guthorm Sperra, should depart from all his claims to the
earldom in right of his mother;<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c017'><sup>[92]</sup></a> and he left with King Hakon,
as hostages for the due fulfilment of his share of the contract,
the following from among his friends and followers:—
William Daniel, knight, Malise Sperra, and David Crichton.</p>

<p class='c008'>But King Hakon died in the year after Earl Henry’s
investiture, and the events that took place in the Orkneys
during the reign of King Olaf, his successor, are entirely unknown
to the Norwegian chroniclers. Earl Henry seems
neither to have courted the favour of his suzerain nor to have
stood in awe of his interference. He built the castle of Kirkwall
in defiance of the prohibition contained in the deed of his
investiture, and seems to have felt himself sufficiently independent
to rule his sea-girt earldom according to his own will
and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fact that King Hakon’s investiture of Earl Henry
took him bound not to enter into any league with the bishop
nor to establish any friendship with him without the king’s
express consent, shows us that the bishop was then acting in
opposition to the king and the representatives of the civil
power.  The likelihood is that Earl Henry found this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxvi'>lxvi</span>opposition of the bishop favourable to his own design of
making himself practically independent, and represented it
as the excuse for the erection of the castle of Kirkwall,
contrary to the terms of his agreement with the crown. Munch
attributes the discord to the growing dislike of the Norwegian
inhabitants of the Islands to Scotsmen, whose numbers had
been long increasing through the influence of the Scottish
family connections of the later earls. Whatever may have
been its origin, the end of it was that in some popular commotion,
of which we have no authentic account, the bishop was
slain in the year 1382.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c017'><sup>[93]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Malise Sperra appears to have endeavoured to establish
himself in Shetland<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c017'><sup>[94]</sup></a> in opposition to Earl Henry. He had
seized, it is not stated upon what grounds, the possessions in
Shetland which had belonged to Herdis Thorvaldsdatter, and
of which Jón Hafthorson and Sigurd Hafthorson were the
lawful heirs. It seems as if a court had been about to be
held by the earl to settle the legal rights of the parties concerned.
The court would be held at the old Thingstead, near
Scalloway, but a conflict took place, the dispute was terminated
by the strong hand, and Malise Sperra was slain.<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c017'><sup>[95]</sup></a> As a
number of his men were slain with him, it seems probable
that he had been the aggressor. As both he and the earl are
among those who were present at the assembly of nobles at
Helsingborg, on the accession of King Eirik of Pomern in
September 1389, and the Iceland Annals place the death of
Malise Sperra in this same year, it is probable that the earl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxvii'>lxvii</span>landed in Shetland on his way home from Norway for the
express purpose of seeing justice done in the cause of the heirs
of Thordis. In 1391, by a deed executed at Kirkwall (and
subsequently confirmed by King Robert III.), he dispones the
lands of Newburgh and Auchdale in Aberdeenshire,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c017'><sup>[96]</sup></a> to his
brother David for his services rendered, and in exchange for
any rights he may have to lands in Orkney and Shetland, derived
from his mother Isabella St. Clair. In 1396 a deed was
executed at Roslin by John de Drummond of Cargyll, and
Elizabeth, his wife, in favour of Henry, Earl of Orkney, Lord
Roslyn, “patri nostro,” by which they renounce in favour of
the earl’s male issue, and for them and their heirs, all claims
to the earl’s lands “infra regnum Norvagie.”<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c017'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The Diploma states that after the death of the first Henry
St. Clair, his mother, the daughter of Malise,<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c017'><sup>[98]</sup></a> came to Orkney,
and, outliving all her sisters and all their sons and daughters,
became the only heiress of the earldom. It is added that of
this thing there were faithful witnesses still living who had
seen and spoken with the mother of Henry the first.</p>

<p class='c008'>Her grandson Henry, son of the first Henry, succeeded to
the earldom, but there seems to be no record of his investiture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxviii'>lxviii</span>by the Norwegian king. In 1404 he was entrusted with the
guardianship of James I., and on his way to France with the
young prince, for whose safety it was judged necessary that he
should be removed from Scotland, he was captured by the
English off Flamborough Head, and retained some time in
captivity.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c017'><sup>[99]</sup></a> In 1412 he went to France with Archibald
Douglas to assist the French against the English.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c017'><sup>[100]</sup></a> In 1418
John St. Clair, his brother, swears fealty to King Eirik at
Helsingborg for the king’s land of Hjaltland, and becomes
bound to administer the Norse laws according to the ancient
usage, and it is stipulated that at his death Shetland should
again revert to the crown of Norway.<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c017'><sup>[101]</sup></a> It seems from this
that Earl Henry must have been dead in 1418, though Bower
in his continuation of Fordun says that he died in 1420.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c017'><sup>[102]</sup></a> A
dispensation was granted for his widow’s marriage in 1418.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c017'><sup>[103]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Henry was succeeded by his son William, the last of the
Orkney earls under Norwegian rule. But the investiture of
the new earl did not take place till 1434, and for a period of
fourteen years the administration of the Islands was carried
on by commissioners appointed by King Eirik.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the death of Earl Henry, Bishop Thomas Tulloch
was appointed commissioner in 1420. He swore fealty to
King Eirik in the church of Vestenskov in Laland, undertaking
the administration of the Islands according to the Norsk
law-book and the ancient usages.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c017'><sup>[104]</sup></a> On 10th July 1422 he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxix'>lxix</span>received as a fief from the king “the palace of Kirkwall and
pertinents, lying in Orkney, in Norway, together with the lands
of Orkney and the government thereof.”<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c017'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>In 1423 the administration of the Orkneys and Shetland
was committed to David Menzies of Wemyss by King Eirik.
In 1426 a complaint was sent to the king by the inhabitants,
setting forth that they had been subjected to oppression and
wholesale spoliation during the period of his administration.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c017'><sup>[106]</sup></a>
Among the accusations preferred against him it was asserted
that he diminished the value of the money by one-half, that
he threw the Lawman of the Islands into prison unjustly, and
illegally possessed himself of the public seal and the law-book
of the Islands, which the Lawman’s wife had deposited on the
altar of the Church of St. Magnus for their security; that he
exacted fines and services illegally and with personal violence,
and was guilty of many other illegal acts of tyrannical oppression.</p>

<p class='c008'>The government of the Islands seems to have been again
entrusted to Bishop Tulloch<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c017'><sup>[107]</sup></a> until 1434, when the young
earl received his formal investiture.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c017'><sup>[108]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>William, the last of the Orkney earls under Norwegian
rule, succeeded to his father Henry, and received investiture
on terms nearly similar to those imposed upon his grandfather.
Moreover, he was to hold for the king and his successors
the castle of Kirkwall, which his grandfather had
built without the king’s consent.  He had taken the title
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxx'>lxx</span>before he received investiture from King Eirik, for in 1426
he appears as Earl of Orkney on the assize at Stirling, for
the trial of Murdoch, Duke of Albany.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c017'><sup>[109]</sup></a> In 1435, as Lord
High Admiral of Scotland, he had command of the fleet that
conveyed the Princess Margaret to France. In 1446 he was
summoned by the Norwegian Rigsraad to appear at Bergen
on next St. John’s Day,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c017'><sup>[110]</sup></a> to take the oath of allegiance to King
Christopher, the successor of Eirik of Pomern. In 1460 the
king’s commissioners in Kirkwall certify to King Christian I.
that John of Ross, Lord of the Isles, has for a long time most
cruelly endeavoured to depopulate the Islands of Orkney and
Shetland by burning the dwellings and slaying the inhabitants,
and that in these circumstances Lord William St. Clair,
the Earl of Orkney and Caithness,<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c017'><sup>[111]</sup></a> had been prevented from
coming to the king.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c017'><sup>[112]</sup></a> On 28th June 1461 Bishop William of
Orkney writes to the king from Kirkwall excusing the earl
for not having come to take the oath of allegiance, because in
the month of June of that year he had been appointed one of
the regents of the Kingdom of Scotland on account of the
tender years of the prince (King James III.), and therefore
was personally resident in Scotland. The bishop also repeats
the complaint against John of Ross, Lord of the Isles, and the
bands of his Islesmen, Irish, and Scots from the woods, “who
came in great multitudes in the month of June, with their
ships and fleets in battle array, wasting the lands, plundering
the farms, destroying habitations, and putting the inhabitants
to the sword, without regard to age or sex.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c017'><sup>[113]</sup></a> Tradition still
points in several parts of the Islands to “the Lewismen’s
graves,” probably those of the invaders who were killed in
their plundering expeditions through the Islands.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the 8th September 1468 a contract of marriage was
signed between James III. of Scotland and Margaret,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxi'>lxxi</span>daughter of King Christian I. of Denmark, Sweden, and
Norway, by which, after discharging the arrears of the
tribute due by Scotland for Man and the Hebrides,<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c017'><sup>[114]</sup></a> King
Christian engaged to pay a dowry of 60,000 florins with his
daughter, stipulating for certain jointure lands (including the
palace of Linlithgow and the castle of Doune), and her terce
of the royal possessions in Scotland if left a widow. Of the
dowry 10,000 florins were to be paid before the princess’s
departure, and the Islands of Orkney were pledged for the
balance of 50,000 florins. Only 2000 florins of the 10,000
promised were paid, and the Islands of Shetland were pledged
for the remainder. The amount for which the whole of the
Islands of Orkney and Shetland were thus impignorated was
58,000 florins of 100 pence each, or about £24,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1471 King James III. gave William, Earl of Orkney,
the castle and lands of Ravenscraig in Fife in exchange for
all his rights to the earldom of Orkney, and an Act of
Parliament was passed on the 20th of February of the same
year annexing to the Scottish Crown “the Erledome of
Orkney and Lordship of Schetland, nocht to be gevin away in
time to cum to na persain or persainis, excep alenarily to
ane of the king’s sonnis of lauchful bed.”</p>
<h3 id='h3-VIII' class='c016'>VIII. <span class='sc'>The Bishopric of Orkney</span>—1060-1469.</h3>
<p class='c007'>The origin of the bishopric of Orkney is involved in
obscurity. Its early history is complicated by the fact that
there were two if not three distinct successions of bishops,
only one of which is recognised by the Norse writers.</p>
<p class='c008'>The Saga statement regarding the origin of the bishopric
unfortunately is lacking in precision. It is stated that Earl
Thorfinn built Christ’s Kirk in Birsay, apparently after his
return from his pilgrimage to Rome, and that the first bishop’s
see in the Orkneys was established there.  Taking this in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxii'>lxxii</span>connection with the statement that William the Old, who was
bishop in 1115, when St. Magnus was murdered, was the first
bishop, the inference would be that the bishopric was erected
in his time. The statement regarding his tenure of office for
sixty-six years is scarcely credible; but supposing it to be the
fact, as he died in 1167, we obtain 1102 as the date of the
erection of the bishopric.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, Adam of Bremen states<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c017'><sup>[115]</sup></a> that Thorolf
was the first Bishop of Orkney, and that he was consecrated
by Adalbert, Archbishop of Hamburg, in the middle of the
11th century,<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c017'><sup>[116]</sup></a> and that another bishop named Adalbert succeeded
him. Now, as William the Old was not consecrated
before 1102, if there was a bishop in Earl Thorfinn’s time
(the date of his death being 1064), it must have been this
Thorolf. If Thorolf was consecrated in the middle of the
11th century, it was probably before Earl Thorfinn’s death in
1064. But it seems that the see was vacant or unoccupied
before 1093.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears from a letter of Lanfranc, Archbishop of
Canterbury (1070-1089), that Earl Paul of Orkney had sent to
him a cleric whom he wished to be consecrated a bishop, and
Lanfranc orders Wulstan, Bishop of Worcester, and Peter,
Bishop of Chester, to go to York and assist the archbishop
there at the consecration. This must refer to the Earl Paul,
son of Thorfinn, who with his brother Erlend was carried to
Norway by King Magnus on his second expedition to the west
in 1098, and neither of them ever returned. The name of
this bishop is not given in Lanfranc’s letter. But the English
writers<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c017'><sup>[117]</sup></a> mention that in the end of the 11th century a cleric
named Ralph was consecrated Bishop of Orkney by Thomas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxiii'>lxxiii</span>Archbishop of York. Thomas was archbishop from <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1070 to
1100. It is mentioned that when the right of the Archbishop
of York to consecrate Turgot Bishop of St. Andrews was
asserted in 1109, it was proposed that he should do it by the
assistance of the (English) Bishops of Scotland and of Orkney.
Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury (1092-1107), wrote<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c017'><sup>[118]</sup></a> to
Earl Hakon Palson, exhorting him and his people to obey
the bishop “whom now by the grace of God they had.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A second bishop, named Roger, was consecrated by Gerard,
who was Archbishop of York in the beginning of the 12th
century, from 1100 to 1108.</p>

<p class='c008'>A third bishop, named Ralph, previously a presbyter of
York, said to have been elected by the people of Orkney, was
consecrated by Archbishop Thomas, the successor of Gerard.
It is this Ralph who figures in the accounts of the battle
of Northallerton, 1138. Pope Calixtus II. and Pope Honorius
II. addressed letters to the Norwegian Kings, Sigurd
and Eystein, in favour of Ralph.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c017'><sup>[119]</sup></a> In the letter of Pope
Honorius it is expressly stated that another bishop had
been intruded in the place of Ralph. This must refer to
William the Old, whom the Sagas make bishop from the
year 1102.</p>

<p class='c008'>The explanation of all this seems to be that the Archbishops
of Hamburg and York both tried in vain to secure the
right of consecrating the Bishops of Orkney; the former on
the ground that as the successors of St. Anschar they were
primates of the Scandinavian churches, and the latter on the
same ground on which they claimed the right to consecrate
the Bishop of St. Andrews—viz. that their jurisdiction extended
to the whole of Scotland and the Isles. In the appendix
to Florence of Worcester’s Chronicle,<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c017'><sup>[120]</sup></a> written in the beginning
of the 12th century, it is said that “the Archbishop of York
had jurisdiction over all the bishops north of the Humber,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxiv'>lxxiv</span>and all the bishops of Scotland and the Orkneys, as the
Archbishop of Canterbury had over those of Ireland and
Wales.” Meantime, however, the Norwegians made their own
bishops, and these, having obtained possession of the see,
were the real bishops of Orkney, though the others might
enjoy the empty title.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus <span class='sc'>William the Old</span> was the first of the actual bishops
of Orkney of whom we have distinct record. As the Saga
and the Saga of St. Magnus both state explicitly that he held
the bishopric for sixty-six years, and the Annals place his
death in 1168, he must have been consecrated in 1102. The
see, which was first at Birsay, where Earl Thorfinn erected
the Christ’s Kirk,<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c017'><sup>[121]</sup></a> was removed to Kirkwall on the erection of
the Cathedral, 1137-52. He went with Earl Rögnvald to the
Holy Land in 1152. When Pope Anastasius erected the
metropolitan see of Trondheim in 1154 he declared the Bishop
of Orkney one of its suffragans, and Bishop William’s
canonical rights were thus implicitly recognised. He died in
1168; and in 1848, when certain repairs were being executed
on the cathedral, his bones were found enclosed in a stone
cist thirty inches long and fifteen inches wide, along with a
bone object like the handle of a staff, and a leaden plate, inscribed
in characters apparently of the 13th century:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Hic requiescit Willialmus senex, felicis memoriæ,</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>primus Episcopus.</span></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The position in which the bones were found in the choir
seems to indicate that they must have been moved from
their previous resting-place. Bishop William’s bones, and
the cist which contained them, were carted away with the
rubbish when the church was re-seated in 1856.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c017'><sup>[122]</sup></a> The leaden
plate and bone object which were found in the cist are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxv'>lxxv</span>preserved in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of
Scotland.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William II.</span>, the second bishop, is only known from the
entry of his name in the list of bishops<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c017'><sup>[123]</sup></a> (1325), and the
entry of his death under the year 1188 in the Icelandic
Annals.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Bjarni</span>, son of Kolbein Hruga (who built the castle on
the island of Weir), was the third bishop. His mother,
Herborg, was a great-granddaughter of Earl Paul.<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c017'><sup>[124]</sup></a> Bjarni
himself was a famous poet, and to him is ascribed the
<i>Jomsvikinga-drapa</i>—the Lay of the Jomsburg Vikings.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c017'><sup>[125]</sup></a> A
bull of Pope Innocent III., dated at the Vatican, 27th May
1198,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c017'><sup>[126]</sup></a> is addressed to him in connection with the refusal of
Bishop John of Caithness to collect an annual tribute in his
diocese, as noticed hereafter.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c017'><sup>[127]</sup></a> It appears from a deed of his
in the Chartulary of the monastery of Munkalif at Bergen
that he possessed lands in Norway, as well as his patrimonial
lands in Orkney and castle in the island of Weir. By that
deed he gives to the monastery, “for the souls of his father
(Kolbein Hruga), his mother, his brother, his relations and
friends,” the lands called <i>Holand</i>, near the Dalsfiord, north of
Bergen. It is curious thus to find in authentic records a
mortification of lands to a church in Norway to provide
masses for the soul of a man who is now known in his own
former home in Orkney only as <i>Cobbie Row</i>, “the giant,” or
“goblin” of the castle, which he built and inhabited. Bishop
Bjarni was present with John, Earl of Orkney, at the great
assembly of nobles at Bergen,<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c017'><sup>[128]</sup></a> in 1223, and died shortly
thereafter.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Jofreyr</span>, the fourth bishop, was consecrated in 1223,
according to the Annals. There was a Jofreyr, Dean of
Tunsberg, present at the same assembly in Bergen above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxvi'>lxxvi</span>referred to, and as the name is a very uncommon one, it is
probable that he is the same who was made Bishop of the
Orkneys. He seems to have been long an invalid, for, by a
bull dated at Viterbo, 11th May 1237,<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c017'><sup>[129]</sup></a> Pope Gregory IX.
enjoins Sigurd, Archbishop of Nidaros (Drontheim), to move
Bishop Jofreyr of Orkney, who had been paralytic and
confined to bed for many years, to resign office, or, if he was
unwilling to resign, to provide him with a wise and prudent
helper. Jofreyr retained the see, however, for ten years after
this. The Annals place his death in 1247.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Henry</span> (I.) was the fifth bishop. A papal dispensation
for the defect of his birth, by Pope Innocent IV., is dated 9th
December 1247.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c017'><sup>[130]</sup></a> He was then a canon in the Orkneys. He
was with King Hakon’s expedition in 1263, and died in 1269.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Peter</span>, the sixth bishop, was consecrated in 1270. A
brief of his,<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c017'><sup>[131]</sup></a> dated at Tunsberg, 3d September 1278, grants
forty days’ indulgence to those in his diocese who contribute
in aid of the restoration of St. Swithin’s cathedral at Stavanger,
which had been destroyed by fire. He died in 1284.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Dolgfinn</span>, the seventh bishop, was consecrated in 1286.
Nothing is known of him but the name. He died, according
to the Annals, in 1309.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William</span> (III.) was the eighth bishop. He was consecrated
in 1310. At the Provincial Council held at Bergen,
in 1320, there were several complaints made by the archbishop
against William, Bishop of Orkney.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c017'><sup>[132]</sup></a>  Kormak, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxvii'>lxxvii</span>archdeacon of the Sudreys, and Grim Ormson, prebendary of
Nidaros, had been sent by the archbishop on a visitation of
the diocese of Orkney, and had reported that William had
squandered the property of the see, that he had bestowed the
offices of the church on foreigners and apostates, that he
had compromised his dignity as a prelate of the church by
participation in the boisterous pastime of hunting and other
unseemly diversions, that he had been careless and lukewarm
in the exercise of his spiritual office, and had not sought out
those who practised idolatry and witchcraft, or who were
heretics or followed ungodly ways. Moreover, he had
imprisoned Ingilbert Lyning, a canon of Orkney, whom the
archbishop had sent to make inquiry into the collection of
the Peter’s pence, and had deprived him of his prebendary
and all his property. He had also clandestinely appropriated
to himself during fifteen years a portion of the church dues,
amounting to the value of 53 marks sterling, and he had
refused to permit the removal of the corpse of a woman from
Orkney, although her will had been that she should be
interred in the cathedral of Trondheim. He was suspended
in the following year (1321) by the archbishop, but in 1324
we find him assisting at the consecration of Laurentius,
Bishop of Hole.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c017'><sup>[133]</sup></a> By a deed,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c017'><sup>[134]</sup></a> dated at Bergen, 9th September
1327, he mortgages his dues of Shetland to his metropolitan,
Eilif, Archbishop of Nidaros, for the payment of 186 marks
sterling, which he should have paid the archbishop for six
years’ teinds. By another document of the same year,<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c017'><sup>[135]</sup></a>
Bishop Audfinn of Bergen requests Bishop William of
Orkney to assist his priest Ivar in the collection of the
<i>Sunnive-miel</i>—a contribution which the inhabitants of Shetland
had paid from old time to the shrine of St. Sunniva at
Bergen. The date of this bishop’s death has not been
ascertained.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William</span> (IV.), ninth bishop, succeeded him, sometime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxviii'>lxxviii</span>after the year 1328. There is extant an agreement between
him and Hakon Jonsson, dated at Kirkwall, 25th May 1369.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c017'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
The next mention we have of him is the entry in the Annals,
under the date 1382—“Then was heard the mournful tidings
that Bishop William was slain in the Orkneys.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William</span> (V.), tenth bishop, appears only in a record of
the time of King Robert III. of Scotland. Munch supposes
that he may have been the William Johnson who appears as
Archdeacon of Zetland, in a Norse deed dated at Sandwick in
Shetland, March 4, 1360.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Henry</span> (II.), eleventh bishop, according to Torfæus,
appears in a record of 1394.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John</span>, twelfth bishop, appears in the Union Treaty of
Calmar in 1397.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Patrick</span>, thirteenth bishop, appears in an Attestation by
the Lawman of Orkney, two canons of the church of St.
Magnus, and four burgesses of Kirkwall, of the descent and
good name of James of Cragy, laird of Hupe.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c017'><sup>[137]</sup></a> He is otherwise
unnoticed, but as he is there referred to by his canonical
title, and the many losses, injuries, and disquietudes which he
endured at the hands of his adversaries, are specially alluded
to, there seems to be no doubt that he held the bishopric
between the death of John and the incumbency of Thomas
de Tulloch.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Thomas</span> de Tulloch, fourteenth bishop, first appears in

Bishop of Ross.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c017'><sup>[138]</sup></a> On 17th June 1420, at the church of
Vestenskov in Laland, he gives his pledge to King Eirik and
his successors, and undertakes that he will hold the crown
lands of Orkney committed to him, for the Kings of Norway,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxix'>lxxix</span>promising at the same time to give law and justice to the
people of Orkney according to the Norsk law-book and the
ancient usages.<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c017'><sup>[139]</sup></a> In 1422 he receives the palace and pertinents
of Kirkwall—“thet slot oc faeste Kirkqwaw liggende j
Orknoy j Norghe meth landet Orknoy,” etc.—as a fief from
King Eirik. A record of the set of the threepenny lands of
Stanbuster, in the parish of St. Andrews, executed by him on
12th July 1455, and confirmed by his successor in 1465, is
preserved at Kirkwall. His death took place before 28th
June 1461, when we find his successor in office.<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c017'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William</span> (VI.) de Tulloch, the last bishop during the
dominion of Norway in the Orkneys, was bishop in June
1461, and tendered his oath of allegiance in 1462.</p>

<p class='c008'>A bull of Pope Sixtus IV., dated at the Vatican, 17th
August 1472, placed the see of the Orkneys under the metropolitan
Bishop of St. Andrews.</p>
<h3 id='h3-IX' class='c016'>IX. <span class='sc'>The Bishopric of Caithness</span>—1150-1469.</h3>
<p class='c007'>The Bishopric of Caithness appears to have been co-extensive
with the older earldom, comprehending Caithness and Sutherland
as far south as Ekkialsbakki or the Kyle of Sutherland.
In later times the cathedral church was at Dornoch.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c017'><sup>[141]</sup></a> But
it would seem as if the episcopal see had at one time been at
Halkirk (called in the Saga <i>Há Kirkia</i>, or the High Kirk),
near Thurso, where we find the bishops frequently residing.
The date of the erection of the bishopric is unknown.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Andrew</span> is the first bishop who appears in authentic
records. About the year 1153 King David granted to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxx'>lxxx</span>the lands of Hoctor Comon,<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c017'><sup>[142]</sup></a> and about the same time he
himself gave a grant of the Church of the Holy Trinity of
Dunkeld to the monks of Dunfermline.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c017'><sup>[143]</sup></a> About the year 1165
he and Murethac, his clerk, are witnesses to a charter of
Gregory, Bishop of Dunkeld, confirming the said gift. About
the year 1181 he is a witness to the grant by Earl Harald
Maddadson to the see of Rome of a penny annually from
every inhabited house in Caithness, which brought his successor,
Bishop John, into such trouble.<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c017'><sup>[144]</sup></a> He is also a witness
to the remarkable document engrossed in the Book of Deer,
by which King David I. declares the clerics of Deer to be
free from all lay interference and undue exaction, “as it is
written in their book, and as they pleaded at Banff and swore
at Aberdeen.”<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c017'><sup>[145]</sup></a> The Chronicle of Mailros records his death
at Dunfermline on 30th December 1185. He seems to have
been a learned man, and was much about the court of David
I. He is said to have been the author of part of the curious
treatise “De Situ Albaniæ,” attributed to Giraldus Cambrensis.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>John</span>, second bishop, succeeded him. He seems to have
refused to exact from the inhabitants the papal contribution
of one penny annually from each inhabited house in Caithness
granted by Earl Harald, for in a bull<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c017'><sup>[146]</sup></a> dated at the Vatican,
27th May 1198, Pope Innocent III. enjoins Bishop Bjarni
of Orkney and Bishop Reginald of Ross to compel Bishop
John to give up his opposition to its collection on pain of the
censure of the Church. About this time also Caithness had
been taken from Harald by King William the Lion, with
whom he was involved in hostilities, and given over to
Reginald Gudrodson, the petty king of the Hebrides. Hence,
on Harald’s recovery of his possessions in 1202, he was so
exasperated that he took vengeance on the bishop<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c017'><sup>[147]</sup></a> by blinding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxi'>lxxxi</span>him and cutting out his tongue, and inflicted severe punishments
on the people, whom he held to have been guilty
of rebellion. Bishop John appears to have survived his
mutilation till 1213.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Adam</span>, third bishop, was consecrated in 1214 by Malvoisin,
Bishop of St. Andrews. He was a foundling exposed at a
church door, but he had been Abbot of Melrose previous to his
appointment to the see of Caithness. In 1218 he went with
the Bishops of Glasgow and Moray on a pilgrimage to Rome.
He seems to have been of an opposite disposition to that of
his predecessor, who suffered martyrdom in the cause of his
people. It was an old custom in Caithness that the husbandmen
paid the bishop a <i>spann</i> of butter for every twenty cows.
Bishop Adam exacted the contribution first for every fifteen,
and at length for every ten cows. Exasperated by these
exactions, the people rose in a body and came to him at Halkirk,
where in the tumult a monk of Newbottle named Serlo
was killed and the bishop himself burned in his own kitchen.
A letter of Pope Honorius III., dated in January 1222, and
addressed to the Scottish bishops of the time, is extant in the
archives of the Vatican,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c017'><sup>[148]</sup></a> in which, after commending King
Alexander for his promptitude and zeal in avenging Bishop
Adam’s murder, he goes on to tell that, having learned from
their letters what a horrible crime, what a detestable deed had
been committed, his spirit quailed and his heart trembled and
his ears tingled as he realised the daring atrocity of the deed.
“Your letters,” he says, “have informed us that a dispute
having arisen between Adam, Bishop of Caithness, of adorable
memory, on the one part, and his parishioners on the other,
concerning the tithes and other rights of the Church, and
these matters having been submitted to the king himself by
the mediation of certain ecclesiastics, with consent of the
bishop, and the king being absent in England, his parishioners,
moved with anger against him because he upheld the cause of
his Church against them, fell on their pious pastor like ravening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxii'>lxxxii</span>wolves, on their father like degenerate sons, and on their
Lord Christ like emissaries of the devil, stripped him of his
clothing, stoned him, mortally wounded him with an axe, and
finally killed and burned him in his own kitchen.” The letter
concludes with an injunction to excommunicate all concerned
in the murder. The bishop’s body was interred in the church
at Skinnet, and is said to have been subsequently removed to
Dornoch in 1239.<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c017'><sup>[149]</sup></a> The Saga states that the fearful vengeance
taken by King Alexander II. for the murder of the bishop
was still fresh in memory in the writer’s time; and we learn
from the Annals that “the Scottish king caused the hands and
feet to be hewn from eighty men who had been present at the
burning, so that many of them died.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Gilbert</span> de Moravia, fourth bishop, had been Archdeacon
of Moray previous to his elevation to the see of Caithness in
1223. He built the cathedral at Dornoch, and his charter of
constitution<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c017'><sup>[150]</sup></a> is still extant in the record-room at Dunrobin
Castle. For many years there had been an intimate connection
between the diocese of Caithness and the abbey of
Scone,<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c017'><sup>[151]</sup></a> and in the constitution of his cathedral Bishop
Gilbert named the Abbot of Scone one of the canons. The
fourteen churches assigned to the prebends were those of Clyne,
Dornoch, Creich, Rogart, Lairg, Farr, Kildonan, and Durness,
in Sutherland; and Bower, Watten, Skinnet, Olrig, Dunnet,
and Canisbay, in Caithness. Golspie and Loth, Reay,
Thurso, Wick, and Latheron, were reserved to the bishop.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxiii'>lxxxiii</span>He seems to have been a man of mark in his time. He built
the “Bishop’s Castle” at Scrabster, and was made keeper of
the king’s castles in the north.<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c017'><sup>[152]</sup></a> He seems also to have been
the first discoverer of gold in Sutherlandshire, for Sir Robert
Gordon states that he “found a mine of gold in Duriness, in
the lands belonging to his bishoprick.” He died at Scrabster
in 1245, and was afterwards canonised. His relics were preserved
in the cathedral church at Dornoch, and continued to
be held in reverence down to the middle of the 16th century.
In a record of the year 1545 it is stated that the parties compearing
before Earl John of Sutherland in the chapter-house
of the cathedral at Dornoch made oath by touching the relics
of the blessed Saint Gilbert. He is the only bishop of Caithness,
except Bishop Adam, whose death is recorded in the
Icelandic Annals. The entry is under the year 1244:—“Death
of Gilibert, bishop in Scotland.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>William</span>, fifth bishop, was his successor. In 1250 he
appears among the other Scottish bishops in a document
addressed to Alexander III. concerning the liberties of the
Church. He died in 1261 or 1262.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Walter</span> de Baltrodin, a canon of Caithness, was chosen
as his successor. Pope Urban IV. in 1263 addressed a letter<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c017'><sup>[153]</sup></a>
to the bishops of Dunkeld, Brechin, and Ross, setting forth
that his election had not been proceeded with according to
canonical form, but as it had been unanimous, and in consideration
of the poverty of the Church, and the expense of
making such long journeys to distant places, he enjoins them
to prefer the said Walter to the bishopric if they find that he
is not disqualified by defect of birth or otherwise. He died
before 1274. On his death, Nicolas, Abbot of Scone, was
chosen as his successor, but rejected by the Pope.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c017'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Archibald</span>, Archdeacon of Moray, was chosen on the
rejection by the Pope of Nicolas, Abbot of Scone. The Pope’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxiv'>lxxxiv</span>letter confirming his election mentions R., the Dean,
Patrick, the treasurer, and Roger de Castello, canon of
Caithness, as the parties by whom he was nominated. In
his time Boyamund de Vitia was commissioned by Pope
Gregory X. to collect a special subsidy in aid of the crusade,
and his accounts furnish us with the names of a number of
the churches in the diocese of Caithness and the amounts
contributed.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c017'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Bishop Archibald must have been dead before 1279, for in
that year the Pope addressed a letter to the Bishops of St.
Andrews and Aberdeen,<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c017'><sup>[156]</sup></a> setting forth that the see of Caithness
being vacant, the chapter had proceeded to the election
of R., the Dean of Caithness, and had constituted Henry
of Nottingan<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c017'><sup>[157]</sup></a> (in Caithness) their procurator to obtain confirmation
of the said election, and that the said Henry, in the
Pope’s presence, had confessed that the said dean had a son
thirty years old or more, and that he was said to have
another, although he (Henry of Nottingan) did not believe
it; and, moreover, that he had been stricken with paralysis,
and was old and debilitated. The bishops are enjoined to use
their influence to oblige him to resign.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Alan</span> de St. Edmund, eighth bishop, was an Englishman,
elected by the influence of Edward I. of England. In 1290
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxv'>lxxxv</span>he signs the letter addressed to that king, proposing a marriage
between the Maid of Norway and the young Prince
Edward. Alan was a favourite with King Edward, and was
made Chancellor of Scotland in 1291. In that year a writ<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c017'><sup>[158]</sup></a>
was addressed by the king to Alexander Comyn, keeper of
the royal forest of Ternway, in Moray, ordering him to give
Bishop Alan 40 oaks suitable for material for the fabric of
the cathedral church of Caithness, which the king had
granted for the souls of Alexander, King of Scotland, and
Margaret, his queen, the sister of King Edward. Bishop
Alan died in 1291, and on his death King Edward ordered
the Bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow to commit the
vacant cure to some cleric in the king’s allegiance.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c017'><sup>[159]</sup></a> The
fulfilment of this mandate is not on record, but we learn
from the letter of Pope Boniface VIII.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c017'><sup>[160]</sup></a> addressed to Bishop
Adam in 1296, that on the death of Alan the chapter of
Caithness had chosen the Archdeacon of Caithness, whose
name is given as I(oannes?) to be his successor, but because
the election had not been in canonical form it was not confirmed
by the Pope, who preferred to the vacant diocese
Adam, then precentor of the church of Ross.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Adam</span>, ninth bishop, as we learn from the Pope’s letter
above mentioned, was not elected in the usual way, but preferred
by the Pope and consecrated by the Bishop of Ostia.
The letter addressed by the Pope<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c017'><sup>[161]</sup></a> “to the chapter of Caithness,
to the people of the district and diocese of Caithness,
and to our dearest son in Christ the King of Scots,” in 1296,
announces his preferment, and the reasons that led to it.
He died at Sienna very shortly after the date of this letter.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c017'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Andrew</span>, abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Cupar,<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c017'><sup>[163]</sup></a> was
now preferred to the see of Caithness; and because, “on account
of the wars that are imminent in those parts, and the dangers
of the way, which is long and perilous, it is impossible for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxvi'>lxxxvi</span>him to approach the apostolic seat for consecration,” a mandate
was addressed to the Bishops of Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Ross,
to give him consecration.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Ferquhard</span>, Bishop of Caithness, appears in 1310, among
the other bishops of Scotland, acknowledging Robert Bruce as
King of Scotland. In 1312, along with Magnus, Earl of
Caithness and Orkney, he attests the payment of 100 marks
sterling (the annual tribute payable for the Hebrides) by
King Robert Bruce to the King of Norway, in St. Magnus’
Cathedral, Kirkwall. He was dead and the see vacant in 1328.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c017'><sup>[164]</sup></a></p>

Caithness.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c017'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Alexander</span> appears as Bishop of Caithness in 1389, when,

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Robert</span> was bishop in 1434, and his successor <span class='sc'>William</span>,
who appears as bishop in 1449, was still in office at the
period of the transference of the Orkneys from the Norwegian
to Scottish rule, in 1469.</p>
<h3 id='h3-X' class='c016'>X. <span class='sc'>Ancient Churches of Orkney.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'>“The Cathedral of St. Magnus,” says Worsaae, “is incontestably
the most glorious monument of the time of the Norwegian
dominion to be found in Scotland.” “It is,” says
Peterkin, “one of the two cathedral churches in Scotland
remaining entire, and is, therefore, a national monument, interesting
from its antiquity, its beauty, and the rarity of such
relics in this part of the empire.” Nothing conveys to the
mind of the stranger visiting Kirkwall a more vivid impression
of the ancient importance of this quaint little town,
which has been the capital of the Orkneys for at least 800
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxviii'>lxxxviii</span>years, than the grandeur of its cathedral, and the imposing
aspect of the ruins of the palaces of the Bishops and Earls of
Orkney.</p>
<p class='c008'>The Saga tells how the erection of the cathedral was undertaken
by Earl Rögnvald II. (Kali Kolson), in fulfilment of
a vow which he had made to build and endow a splendid
stone minster in Kirkwall in honour of St. Magnus, his
mother’s brother, from whom he derived his right to a share
of the earldom of the Orkneys. He won the earldom in the
year 1136, and the erection of the cathedral was commenced
under the superintendence of his father Kol, in 1137, and
carried on until the earl’s means failed. By agreement with
the odallers, a mark for each ploughland in the islands was
contributed for the purpose of carrying on the work, and this
brought in money enough to enable the erection of the church
to be proceeded with.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cathedral, as it now stands, however, is by no means
the work of Earl Rögnvald’s time, although the portion built
by him is still clearly distinguishable. “The church,” says
Sir Henry Dryden,<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c017'><sup>[176]</sup></a> “as designed and partly built in the time
of Kol (father of Earl Rögnvald), was of the same width as at
present, but possibly one bay shorter at the west end. There
can be little doubt that the choir terminated in an apse, which
began about half-way along the great piers in front of the subsequent
altar steps, and extended as far as the line of those
steps. The builders, having laid out the whole church, carried
up the choir and its two aisles and the transepts to the eaves,
and built the piers of the central tower.” The architectural
history of the structure, however, is puzzling. “Though I
spent eighteen weeks at the cathedral,” says Sir Henry in a
letter to Mr. Worsaae, “and have thought over the thing
many times, I cannot make out the history of the building to
my own satisfaction. There is no doubt that there is a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_lxxxix'>lxxxix</span>deal of copying in it, <i>i.e.</i> of building at one time in the style
of another.”<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c017'><sup>[177]</sup></a> The chief interest of the structure lies in the
fact that it was built by a Norwegian earl, and designed and
superintended by the Norwegian Kol, who had the principal
oversight of the whole work. It is significant of their
community of origin that the oldest portions of St. Magnus
show traces of the same peculiarities of style which are found
in the nearly contemporary but somewhat older Norman
churches in Normandy, the home of the Christian descendants
of the Vikings who followed Hrólf the Conqueror, son of
Rögnvald, Earl of Moeri.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cathedral was erected for the express purpose of receiving
the relics of St. Magnus, but we have no record of
their transference to the new church. There is reason to believe
that they had been brought to Kirkwall before the
erection of the cathedral was begun, and, though it is not so
stated, it may be inferred that on their removal from Christ’s
Church in Birsay, they were deposited in the church of St.
Olaf at Kirkwall, and remained there for some years until the
cathedral was ready to receive them. It seems probable that
it is to the church of St. Olaf that Kirkwall owes its name
of <i>Kirkiu-vagr</i>, the Creek of the Kirk. This name does not
occur in the Saga before the time of Earl Rögnvald Brusison,
who is said to have resided there, and it is most likely that
the church of St. Olaf was built by him in memory of his
foster-father, King Olaf the Holy. Earl Rögnvald was in the
battle of Stiklestad (1030) in which the warrior saint of Norway
fell, and being his foster-son he was more likely than any
of the subsequent earls to dedicate a church to his memory.
We are told in the Saga<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c017'><sup>[178]</sup></a> that the relics of St. Magnus
were exhumed by Bishop William twenty years after his death
and placed in a shrine at Christ’s Kirk. Shortly thereafter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xc'>xc</span>says the Saga, St. Magnus appeared in a dream to a man who
lived in Westray, by name Gunni, and ordered him to tell
Bishop William that he (St. Magnus) wished to go out of
Birgishérad and east to Kirkwall. Gunni was afraid to do
so lest he should excite the wrath of Earl Paul, whose father
had been the murderer of St. Magnus. The following night
St. Magnus again appeared to him, ordering him to disclose
his dream whatever the consequences might be, and threatening
him with punishment in the life hereafter if he disobeyed.
Struck with terror, Gunni went to the Bishop and told him
in the presence of Earl Paul and all the congregation. Earl
Paul, it is said, turned red with anger, but all the men there
united in requesting the bishop to proceed at once to carry
the wishes of St. Magnus into execution. So the bishop went
east to Kirkwall with the relics, accompanied by a great concourse
of people, and “placed them in a shrine upon the altar
of the church which then was there,” and which could have
been no other than St. Olaf’s,<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c017'><sup>[179]</sup></a> seeing that the building of the
cathedral was not commenced until after Earl Paul had been
carried off to Athole by Swein Asleifson. The Saga of St.
Magnus adds that there were then few houses in the town,
but that after the relics of St. Magnus had been transferred
thither the town rapidly increased.</p>

removal to Bergen. Worsaae states that the remains of the
Princess Margaret, the Maid of Norway, were interred in the
cathedral in 1290, and the local tradition is to the same effect,
but there is no authority for the statement. The princess’s
remains were taken back to Norway and buried in the High

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Egilsey Church</span>, on the little isle of Egilsey, is interesting
from the suggestions of its connection
with the earlier Christianity of
the islands previous to the Norse invasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The church stands on the highest
ground of the island, on the west side,
and is a conspicuous object in the
landscape from all sides.  It consists
of chancel and nave, but differs
from all the existing churches in the
islands in having a round tower rising
at the west end of the nave. It is of
small size, the nave being 30 feet long
by 15½ feet in breadth inside, and the
chancel 15 feet long by 9½ feet in
breadth. The chancel is vaulted, and
the walls are about 3 feet thick.
The tower, which seems to have been
built with the nave, is 7 feet diameter
inside, and is now 48 feet high, the
walls being about 3½ feet thick. It
is stated that about 15 feet were taken
off the height to prevent its falling.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c017'><sup>[182]</sup></a> The only two windows in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xcii'>xcii</span>the nave that are original are round-headed and 3 feet high,
with jambs splaying inwards from 8½ to 33 inches wide, and
having no external chamfer. Two windows in the chancel are
exactly similar but smaller. Over the chancel vault there is
a small chamber lighted by a flat-headed window 18 inches
high.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its original dedication is unknown,<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c017'><sup>[183]</sup></a> and there is nothing
to fix the date of its erection with absolute certainty.</p>

<p><span class='small'>EGILSEY CHURCH, from the South east</span><br /><span class='small'>(from a Photograph)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“The church of Egilsey,” says Munch, “is shown by its
construction to have been built before the Northmen arrived
in Orkney, or, at all events, to belong to the more ancient
Christian Celtic population; both its exterior and its interior
show so many resemblances to the old churches in Ireland of
the 7th and 8th centuries, that we are compelled to suppose
it to have been erected at that time by Irish priests or <i>Papas</i>.
As we find no remains of any similar churches on the islands,<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c017'><sup>[184]</sup></a>
we must suppose it to have been the first of the few on the
thinly inhabited isle-group. The island on which it stood
might, therefore, very justly be called ‘Church isle.’ But the
Irish word <i>Ecclais</i> (church), derived from the Latin <i>Ecclesia</i>,
might easily be mistaken by our forefathers for Egils, the
genitive of the man’s name Egil.”</p>

<p class='c008'>If we could unhesitatingly adopt Munch’s view of the
origin of the name Egilsey, it might be safely assumed that
this was the church which gave its name to the island, as no
other ecclesiastical site is known within its bounds. The
Norsemen were heathens down to the time of the Christianising
cruise of King Olaf Tryggvason in <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1000, and not
very hearty in their Christianity for a long time after that.
The church could not have been built, therefore, between 872
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xciii'>xciii</span>and the accession of Earl Thorfinn in 1014. Nor is it likely
to have been erected during Thorfinn’s minority, for he was
only five years old when his father fell fighting under a heathen
banner at Clontarf. The Saga tells that Thorfinn built
Christ’s Church in Birsay, and made it the first bishop’s see
in the Orkneys. If he, or any of his successors previous to
the death of St. Magnus, had erected such a notable structure
as that of Egilsey, it would probably have been recorded.
There was a church in Egilsey in 1115 when St. Magnus was
murdered, and the only question is whether it was the present
church. Its resemblances to the Irish churches of the 7th
and 8th centuries are not sufficiently definite and determinative
to enable us to assign to it unhesitatingly an Irish origin;
while, on the other hand, the resemblance to the round-towered
churches of Norfolk suggests that it may have been of Scandinavian
origin. But there is nothing in the architecture of
the building either to fix the date of its erection or to determine
the questions of Celtic or Scandinavian origin with any
degree of certainty.<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c017'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Church of Orphir</span> is one of the few circular
churches in Britain, built in imitation of the church of the
Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. The crusades were the means of
importing this form into the ecclesiastical architecture of the
west. A few of these round churches remain in Denmark, and,
like those of England, they are mostly of the 12th century.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c017'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xciv'>xciv</span>All that remains of this interesting structure is merely
the semicircular chancel and about 9 feet of the walls of the
circular nave on either side, as shown in the annexed ground-plan.
It is described in the Old Statistical Account as having
been a rotundo, 18 feet in diameter and 20 feet high, two-thirds
of which were taken down to build the present
parish church. The curvature of the part of the walls still
remaining would give a diameter of 18 to 19 feet. The semicircular
chancel is 7 feet wide and a little more than 7 feet
deep. The walls are well built of yellow Orphir freestone.
The only remaining window is a small one in the east end
of the chancel, 30 inches high, having a semicircular head,
and the jambs splaying inwards from 10½ inches to 20 inches
wide. It has a groove for glass.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Rev. Alex. Pope of Reay, who visited Orphir in 1758,
has given a description of “The Temple of Orphir, or Gerth
House,” but there is little to be gathered from it, and the
measurements as given<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c017'><sup>[187]</sup></a> are evidently wrong. He states,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xcv'>xcv</span>however, that extensive remains, supposed to be those of the
Earls’ Palace at Orphir, had been discovered in excavating the
foundations of the neighbouring farm-buildings. Indications
of these, and of an extensive refuse-heap, are still to be seen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The church of Orphir is first mentioned in the Saga in
connection with Earl Paul Hakonson’s residence at Orphir.
The church is there referred to as a splendid structure, and it
is not spoken of as recently erected, or as having been built
by Earl Paul. But Earl Hakon, his father, who had made a
pilgrimage to Rome and the Holy Land, is said in the Saga to
have brought back relics which he would doubtless deposit in
the church at Orphir, where he seems to have resided. The
probability is that the church was built by him after his
return from his pilgrimage, perhaps as an expiatory offering
for the murder of his cousin, St. Magnus. Earl Hakon died
in 1122, and three out of the six round churches in Britain
had been built before that time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Christ’s Church</span> in Birsay is the first church of which we
have any record in the Saga, and, so far as we know, the first
church erected in the Orkneys after the conversion of the
Norwegian inhabitants to Christianity. It was built by Earl
Thorfinn some time about the middle of the 11th century.
Earl Thorfinn made a pilgrimage to Rome about the year
1050, and it is likely that Christ’s Church would be built
after his return to Orkney, or between 1050 and 1064, the
date of his death. It was the seat of the bishopric previous
to the erection of the cathedral of St. Magnus, and William
the Old, who was the first (actual) bishop, lived to see the
bishopric transferred to Kirkwall some time after 1137.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is doubtful whether any recognisable traces of the
original Christ’s Church now remain. Neale says, “The
parish church, which contains some fragments of old work,
seems to have been the famous Christ’s Church built by Earl
Thorfinn.” But it does not seem at all likely that any portion
of the existing parish church can be as old as the middle of
the 11th century. There are remains of an older church, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xcvi'>xcvi</span>beside it, which are still known as the Christ’s Kirk, and
Mr. George Petrie, who has made a ground-plan of the structure
(of which only part of the foundation remains), has ascertained
that it had an apse at the east end.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Church of Weir</span>, on the island of the same name,
consists of chancel and nave, the
extreme length exteriorly being 36
feet, and the width 18½ feet. The
nave is 19 feet by 13 feet inside, and
the chancel little more than 7 feet
square. The door is in the west end,
having parallel jambs with no rebate.
The doorway has a semicircular head,
roughly arched with thin slaty stones
set on edge, the arch being set a
little back on the imposts.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c017'><sup>[188]</sup></a> There
are two windows on the south side
of the nave, only one of which appears
to be original. It is flat-headed,
22 inches high and 8 inches wide,
the jambs splaying inwards to a
width of 27 inches. The chancel arch, of which a representation
is given in the accompanying plate, is exactly like
the doorway. There is one window in the south side, which
seems to have been round-headed, 27 inches high by 11
inches wide.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of this chapel Mr. Muir says,<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c017'><sup>[189]</sup></a> “Excepting that at Lybster,
in Caithness, the entrance to the chancel is the most diminutive,
not of primitive date, I have ever seen, the total height being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xcvii'>xcvii</span>only 4 feet. In plan, size, and general expression, Weir and
Lybster are remarkably alike, and in all probability both
buildings are the work of the same period, though Lybster
is perhaps fully the older of the two.” Sir Henry Dryden also
remarks the similarity of the chapels of Weir and Lybster,
and adds “Probably Weir is of the 12th or 13th century, but
the characteristics are not decisive enough to approximate
more closely to its date.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It is most probable that this chapel<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c017'><sup>[190]</sup></a> was built by Bishop
Bjarni, the son of Kolbein Hruga, who built the castle on the
island of Weir, as recorded in the Saga. Bjarni was bishop
from 1188 to 1223, and would probably reside on his paternal
estate in Weir when not required
by the duties of the episcopate to
be in Kirkwall. This period answers
to the indications afforded by the
architectural characteristics of the
building, and we have no record of
any other person who was likely to
have erected a chapel on this little
island. The fact that it is still
called “Cobbie Row’s Chapel”
points to its connection with Kolbein
Hruga’s family.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='sc'>Church at Lybster</span><a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c017'><sup>[191]</sup></a>
(Reay), in Caithness, corresponds
in style and plan so closely to the
church of Weir that it may be described
here briefly. There is no
other church in Caithness of any antiquity which demands
special notice. Ecclesiastical sites of early date are thickly
scattered over the county, but the ruins of the buildings themselves
have suffered so much that there is scarcely an architectural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xcviii'>xcviii</span>feature left to guide us to conclusions as to their date. The
church at Lybster is fortunately an exception. It consists of
chancel and nave, slightly larger than Weir, and very rudely
constructed. There is a doorway with inclined jambs in the
west end, of which a representation is given in the accompanying
plate; but Mr. Muir notices as a singular feature of
the building that there are nowhere traces of windows, although
all the elevations except the east one, which is broken down
to a little below the gable line, remain nearly entire. The
entrance to the chancel is of the same form as the doorway,
having inclined jambs. “With regard to even the probable
age of this building,” says Mr. Muir, “I would not like to
venture an opinion. The diversified shapes and sizes of the
stones, and the primitive form and smallness of the entrances
to the nave and chancel, would suggest extreme earliness of
date; whilst, on the other hand, the refined character of the
ground-plan would indicate a period of time not more remote
than the 12th century.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>St. Peter’s Church</span>, on the Brough of Birsay, a holm of
about 40 acres, separated from the mainland by a channel
about 150 yards wide, and dry at low water, consists of nave,
chancel, and apse, all well defined, and apparently built at the
same time, the material being a grey whinstone. The total
length of the building is 57 feet. The nave is 28 feet by
15½ inside, and the chancel about 10 feet square. There is
but one doorway, in the west end of the church. It has
parallel jambs without any rebate for a door.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c017'><sup>[192]</sup></a> There are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xcix'>xcix</span>the remains of a window in the north wall, 3 feet high by
10½ inches wide, square-headed, and splaying both internally
and externally to a width of 22½ inches. Only the foundations
of the apse remain. The floor was originally level to
the end of the apse, but subsequently there had been a reredos
which blocked off the apse, and then there were steps to the
altar, some portion of which still remains. A stone projection
or “seat,” 14 inches high and the same in width, runs
all round the nave. In the north-east and south-east corners
are two circular spaces, 5½ feet in diameter, in one of which
are the remains of a spiral stone staircase.  In all probability
the church was twin-towered, like many of the Scandinavian
churches dating from the 13th century.  Barry
states that this church was dedicated to St. Peter, but the dedication
seems to have been unknown in the locality<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c017'><sup>[193]</sup></a> in 1627.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are the remains of a chapel similarly situated on
the Brough of Deerness, at the east end of the Mainland.
The Brough of Deerness is an outlying rock, nearly 100 feet
high, and covered with green sward on the top. The chapel
stands near the centre of the area, and is surrounded by a
stone wall enclosing an area of about 60 feet by 45. The
chapel, which is a smaller and ruder building than that
on the Brough of Birsay, is a simple parallelogram of
not more than 17 feet by 10 inside, the walls being from
3 to 4 feet thick. The doorway is in the west end, and there
are the remains of a window in the east end, but the heads
of both are gone.  Around the chapel there are the foundations
of about a score of stone-built huts scattered irregularly
over the area of the Brough.  They are irregularly
built, with a tendency towards the rectangular form, the
walls being from 2½ to 3 feet thick. Several of them are
nearly as long as the church, but not so wide, the internal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_c'>c</span>area measuring about 18 feet by 6. Low<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c017'><sup>[194]</sup></a> states that in his
time, notwithstanding the difficulty and danger of the access
to the Brough, “even old age scrambled its way through a
road in many places not six inches broad, where certain death
attended a slip.” Jo. Ben, in 1529, mentions that people
of all classes and conditions were in the habit of climbing
up to the top of the Brough on their hands and knees to
visit the chapel called the “Bairns of Brugh;” and when
they had reached the top, “on their bended knees and with
hands joined they offered their supplications with many incantations
to the Bairns of Brugh, throwing stones and water
behind their backs, and making the circuit of the chapel
twice or thrice.” There is still a fine spring on the Brough,
which doubtless had the reputation of a “holy well” in connection
with these superstitious practices. The Brough was
fenced with a strong stone wall toward the land side in Low’s
time, and from this and the remains of the huts he concludes
that it had been a rock fort subsequently converted into a
sanctuary by the ecclesiastics.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old parish church of Deerness, of which Low has preserved
three sketches (one of which is engraved in Hibbert’s
Shetland), had the peculiarity of being twin-towered, as the
church on the Brough of Birsay seems also to have been, and
as many of the Scandinavian churches dating from the 13th
century were.<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c017'><sup>[195]</sup></a> Low describes it as having a vaulted chancel
at the east end, of which the twin towers rose from each
corner. The tower on the south-east corner of the chancel
was entered by a doorway opening from the chancel (in the
same manner as the one at Brough of Birsay), and a spiral
staircase led to a small apartment or vestry between the
towers, on the second storey. From this apartment was the
entrance to the other tower.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_ci'>ci</span>There were three towered churches in Shetland—St. Laurence
in West Burra, St. Magnus at Tingwall, and Ireland
Head, but, like the old church of Deerness, they have long
disappeared, and there is no description of them more precise
than the casual notices of Low and Brand. It is not even
quite clear whether they were single-towered or twin-towered.
If single-towered they may have been examples of the rare
form of which Egilsey is now the only remaining instance.</p>
<h3 id='h3-XI' class='c016'>XI. <span class='sc'>Maeshow and the Stones of Stennis.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'>Maeshow, the Orkahaug of the Saga, is connected in such
an interesting way with the Norse history of the Isles that it
is necessary to notice briefly its most peculiar features.</p>
<p class='c008'>It stands about a mile to the north-east of the great stone
ring of Stennis. Its external appearance is that of a truncated
conical mound of earth, about 300 feet in circumference
at the base and 36 feet high, surrounded by a trench 40 feet
wide. Nothing was known of its internal structure till the
year 1861, when it was opened by Mr. Farrer, M.P.,<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c017'><sup>[196]</sup></a> but the
common tradition of the country represented it as the abode
of a goblin, who was named “the Hogboy,”<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c017'><sup>[197]</sup></a> though no one
knew why. When excavated, the mound was found to cover
a great cairn of stones, in the centre of which was a chamber
about 15 feet square, the walls of which still remained entire
to a height of 13 feet. A long low passage led from the west
side of the chamber to the exterior of the mound, a distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cii'>cii</span>of about 54 feet, and on the other three sides of the chamber
there were small cells or <i>loculi</i> entered by openings in the
walls about 2½ feet square at a height of about 3 feet above
the floor.</p>

but to a special variety of that class which is peculiar
to the Orkneys.<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c017'><sup>[198]</sup></a> These chambered tombs occur in groups in
certain places, thus suggesting the probability that, as in the

been for centuries the gathering places of the tribes and the
burying-places of their kings.</p>

<p><span class='small'>View of Chamber in Maeshow.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But the most interesting fact connected with Maeshow
was the discovery that a large number of Runic inscriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ciii'>ciii</span>had been scratched on the stones of the interior walls of the
chamber. It was evident, from the height at which the inscriptions
occurred, as well as from indications of the weathering
of the stones previous to their being inscribed, that when
the runes were cut the chamber was roofless and partially
filled up with rubbish. The form of the letters of which the
inscriptions are composed is that of the later class of Norse
Runes, “which,” says Professor Munch, “are never older than
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1100 at least.” The majority of the inscriptions are such
as men seeking the shelter or concealment of the “broken
how” might scribble from mere idleness. One gives the
Runic alphabet. A number of others are simple memoranda
consisting of the name of a man and the statement that he
“hewed this” or “carved these runes.” But one of the
longer inscriptions supplies the important information that
“the Jorsala-farers broke open the Orkahaug in the lifetime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_civ'>civ</span>of the blessed earl.” This seems to imply that the inscription
was carved after the death of “the blessed earl” Rögnvald,
or subsequent to 1158. The Jorsala-farers who accompanied
him from Norway in 1152 remained a considerable
time in Orkney before the expedition was ready, and as we
learn from the Saga their conduct during that time was such
as would naturally result from the enforced idleness of a
numerous body of rough and uncontrolled adventurers. The
“breaking of a how” in the hope of finding treasure was a
common exploit among the Northmen. It seems to have
been done sometimes also as a proof of courage, for the bravest
were not altogether void of superstitious fears. From another
part of the inscription we gather that the Jorsala-farers
who broke the Orkahaug were disappointed in the hope of
finding treasure, as it had been previously carried away. In
all probability they were not the first who had been tempted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cv'>cv</span>by the magnitude of the monument to try the venture. On
one of the buttresses, long slabs inserted in the corners of
the chamber, is carved a cross, and on another a dragon,
similar in style to that in the tomb of King Gorm the Old
at Jellinge in Denmark, and bearing also some resemblance
to one sculptured on the Runic stone dug up in St. Paul’s
Churchyard, London, and to another at Hunestad in Scania.
The tomb of King Gorm is dated about the middle of the
10th century. Rafn assigns the stone dug up in London to
about the middle of the 11th century; while the Hunestad
example is assigned to about 1150, which is close on the
date of Earl Rögnvald’s expedition to the Holy Land, which
brought the Jorsala-farers to Orkney.</p>

are those of Ingibiorg, Ingigerd, Thorer, Helgi, Ingi, and Arnfinn.
All these are names of persons who are mentioned in the
Saga as living in Earl Rögnvald’s time, and several of whom
were closely connected with him. Ingigerd, his daughter,
was married to Eric Slagbrellir, and they had a daughter

Rögnvald’s. Arnfinn was taken prisoner by Earl Harald the

at Orkahaug on his way to surprise Earl Erlend.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c017'><sup>[199]</sup></a> There is
nothing, however, to identify any of these names with certainty
as the names of the persons mentioned in the Saga.
But the fact that the name Orkahaug, which only occurs once
in the Saga, is not known to occur anywhere else except
in the inscription carved on the walls of Maeshow, referring
to the breaking open of the tumulus, is interesting in
more ways than one. It shows that the Norsemen were
ignorant of the origin of the tumulus, which they knew only
as the Orka-haug<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c017'><sup>[200]</sup></a> or “mighty how.” In one of the inscriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cvi'>cvi</span>the writer assigns its construction to the sons of Lodbrok,
which is equivalent to saying that its origin was quite
unknown<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c017'><sup>[201]</sup></a> to them.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Ring of Brogar, from the south-west.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>About a mile to the south-west of Maeshow, and scattered
over the ness or tongue of land separating the loch of Stennis
from the sea, is a remarkable group of stone circles and
tumuli.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c017'><sup>[202]</sup></a> The largest of the circles, the “Ring of Brogar,”
having a diameter of 366 feet, encloses an area of 2½ acres.
It is surrounded by a trench 29 feet broad and 6 feet deep.
Within the enclosure thirteen stones of the great circle still
remain standing, the stumps of thirteen more are visible, and
ten are lying prostrate. The original number of the stones,
says Captain Thomas, on the presumption that they were
placed at nearly equal distances apart, would have been sixty,
so that twenty-four have been entirely obliterated. The highest
stone stands almost 14 feet above the surface of the ground,
and the lowest is about 6 feet, the average being from 8 to 10
feet. It is difficult to realise the amount of laborious effort
expended in the construction of a work like this, which does
not appeal to the eye like the magnitude of the great mounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cvii'>cvii</span>around it. But when one reflects on what is implied in the
transportation and erection of these great stones, and the
excavation of a ditch round them of 10 yards wide, 2 yards
deep, and 366 yards long, it loses none of its magnificence in
comparison with the more imposing monuments.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The smaller circle, called the “Ring of Stennis,” is more
clearly monumental than the Ring of Brogar, as it contains
the remains of a cromlech within it. It seems to have consisted
originally of twelve stones placed round the circumference
of a circle of about 100 feet in diameter, and surrounded
by a deep and broad trench with a circumscribing
mound, now nearly obliterated. Only two stones of the circle
remain standing, and a third lies prostrate. Peterkin states
that some were thrown down and removed by the tenant of
the adjoining lands in 1814. The cromlech is also thrown
down, but one of the supports of the massive capstone is still
standing, and the capstone, which lies beside it, is 9 feet long
by 6 feet broad.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Ring of Bookan is a circular space 136 feet in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cviii'>cviii</span>diameter, surrounded by a trench 44 feet broad and 6 feet
deep. There are upwards of twenty tumuli, some of them
very large, in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Saga of Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, Stennis is mentioned
as the place where Havard, eldest of the five sons of Earl
Thorfinn Hausakliuf, was slain in battle with his sister’s son
Einar. The Saga says:<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c017'><sup>[203]</sup></a>—“Havard was then at Stæinsnes
in Hrossey. There it was they met, and there was a hard
battle, and it was not long till the Earl fell. The place is now
called Havard’s <i>teigr</i>.” Teigr is an individual’s share, or
allotment, of the tun or town-land, and the expression might
be taken to mean rather that Havard was buried by simple
inhumation than that there was a cairn or tumulus raised
over him, in which case it would have been known as
Havard’s How. But the name of Havard was never connected
with the great tumulus known as Maeshow, and if he
was buried in a tumulus at all, it is more likely that his
corpse was burnt with the customary ceremonies of that
heathen time and his ashes placed in a great stone urn. The
grave-mounds of the Viking period in Norway prove this to
have been then the common practice. Such a mound, enclosing
such an urn, was opened at Stennis by Mr. Farrer, M.P.,
in 1853. This tumulus, if not Havard’s, was apparently
Norse, and being the largest in the neighbourhood of Stennis,
must have been that of a person of great distinction.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fact that the Norsemen at this early period (about
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 970) called this place Steins-ness, shows that it was
known to them, only as it is to us, as the ness of the monumental
stones. If they had had anything to do with the
erection of any of these monuments, in all probability we
should have had some incidental record of the fact in one or
other of the Sagas.</p>

  <h3 id='h3-XII' class='c016'>XII. <span class='sc'>Mousa and the Pictish Towers.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'>The little island of Mousa (the Mosey of the Saga), lying
off the Mainland of Shetland, is interesting as containing the
best preserved specimen of the “towers of defence,” which
were the strongholds of the native inhabitants previous to the
Norse invasion.</p>
<div id='i-cix'  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/cix.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>The tower of Mousa, of which a view is here given, consists
of a circular dry-built wall, 15 feet thick at the base,
enclosing an area or circular court 30 feet in diameter, and
open to the sky, so as to admit light to the ranges of windows
which open from the galleries towards the interior. The
doorway leading through the wall into this interior court is
the only opening to the outside of the tower. From the court
other openings in the wall give access to small ovoid chambers
in the thickness of the wall on the ground-floor, and to a stair
which ascends to the upper galleries. Above the chambers
on the ground-floor the wall is carried up hollow, or rather
there are two concentric walls with a space of about 3½ feet
between them, which is divided into storeys or galleries by
horizontal courses of transverse slabs, which bind the two
walls together. Thus each of these courses of horizontal slabs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cx'>cx</span>forms the roof of the gallery beneath it, and serves as a floor
to the one above it.</p>

<p class='c008'>These singularly-constructed towers were once thickly
planted over the whole of the northern mainland of Scotland,
as well as over the most of the Northern and Western
Isles.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c017'><sup>[204]</sup></a> A number of them have been excavated of late years,
and the results of these excavations<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c017'><sup>[205]</sup></a> furnish us with interesting
evidences of the conditions of life among the people who lived
in them. The relics that have been obtained from them have
no connection as a class with those that are usually found in
the cisted graves and chambered tombs of earlier times.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c017'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
But judging from the general character of their included
remains, the people who lived in these towers were possessed
of a considerable degree of civilisation. There is abundant
evidence that they were not only expert hunters and fishers,
but that they kept flocks and herds, grew grain and ground it
by hand-mills,<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c017'><sup>[207]</sup></a> practised the arts of spinning and weaving,
had ornaments of gold of curious workmanship, and were not
unskilled workers in bronze and iron. Their pottery was
rude, but not ruder than the pottery manufactured and used for
common or domestic purposes in some of the islands of Scotland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxi'>cxi</span>within the present century. It is true that silver denarii
of the Roman Emperors Antoninus, Trajan, and Vespasian,
have been found in the outbuildings connected with the Broch
or “Pictish Tower” of Lingrow at Scapa in Orkney; but it is
to be noticed that upwards of 4000 of these Roman denarii have
been found in Scandinavia, where the Romans never were, and
found so often associated with relics of the Viking period as
to suggest that they were carried thither some centuries after
their dates.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Tower of Mousa, Moseyjar-borg, is twice mentioned
by the Saga writers. The earliest notice occurs in the Saga
of Egill Skalagrimson, the warrior-poet, and refers to a period
about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 900. It is there stated that Björn Brynulfson, fleeing
from Norway with Thora Roald’s daughter, because his father
would not allow him to celebrate his marriage with her, was
shipwrecked on the island of Mousa, landed his cargo, and
lived in the Borg through the winter, celebrating his marriage
in it, and afterwards sailed for Iceland. The second notice
of Mousa,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c017'><sup>[208]</sup></a> singularly enough, occurs on an occasion somewhat
similar to this, when Earl Erlend Ungi fled from Orkney
with Margaret, the widow of Maddad, Earl of Athole, and was
besieged in the Borg by Earl Harald (Maddadson), who was
displeased at the prospect of having Erlend for a step-father.</p>

<h3 id='h3-XIII' class='c016'>XIII. <span class='sc'>Remains of the Northmen.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'>Turning from the pages of the Saga to the scenes of the
events which it records, we find, both in the topography and
traditions of the localities, and in the customs and characteristics
of the people, abundant evidence of the substantial truth
of the narrative.</p>
<p class='c008'>The range of territory possessed and occupied by the
Norsemen may still be distinguished on the map of Scotland
by the prevalence of Norse place-names. In Shetland and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxii'>cxii</span>Orkney the topography is altogether Norse. In Caithness
and Sutherland there is a core of Celtic topography in the central
mountain districts, while the Norse names spread out
through the valleys, forming a broad fringe along the seaboard,
and occupying the whole angle of lowland Caithness.
But south of Ekkialsbakki they rapidly thin out, and finally
disappear, with a few outlying instances, in Moray. The permanent
dominions of the Northmen in the mainland of Scotland
were limited to the earldom proper, the southern boundary
of which was the Kyle of Sutherland. The Saga says
they conquered the country as far south as Ekkialsbakki; and
though they sometimes extended their power over parts of
Ross and Moray, and even made a raid on one occasion as far
south as Fife, they made no permanent lodgment south of the
Moray Firth, and their presence in Ross has but slightly
affected the topography between the Kyle of Sutherland and
the Beauly Firth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the Hebrides the Norse names, though much disguised
by contact with the Celtic, still form a considerable if not a
preponderating element in the topography, and their old Norse
name, “Sudreyar,” still survives in the title of the Bishop of
Sodor and Man. Along the western seaboard of the Scottish
mainland, from Cape Wrath to the Mull of Kintyre, the Northmen
have left their traces more sparsely, but very distinctly,
upon the topography. In Bute, Arran, and the Cumbraes, and
on the shores of the Solway Firth, the topography also shows
the influence of the Northern element, exerted during the
existence of the Norse “Kingdom of Man and the Isles.”</p>

<p class='c008'>There are many remnants of the older usages<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c017'><sup>[209]</sup></a> in the peculiar
local customs; and in the characteristics of the people of
the Northern Isles there are also, of necessity, many striking
resemblances to those of the Scandinavian race. The elucidation
of these, however, would lead into a field far too wide to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxiii'>cxiii</span>be entered on here. The language of the early colonists, which
must have survived as long as the Islands were governed
“according to the Norse law-book and the ancient usages,”
seems to have died out rapidly after they were transferred to
Scottish rule. Yet Jo. Ben found it existing in Rendal in
Orkney in 1529; and it is stated<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c017'><sup>[210]</sup></a> that in 1593 a clergyman,
named Magnus Norsk, who was ordained to a Shetland parish,
went to Norway to learn the Norse language, in order to qualify
himself for his ministry, because the Shetlanders at that
time understood no other tongue. Even so late as 1774, Low
found people in Foula who could repeat the Lord’s Prayer in
Norse, and he gives thirty-five stanzas of an old Norse ballad
which he took down from oral recitation. In the Faroe Isles
a large number of these ballads and metrical tales have been
collected.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c017'><sup>[211]</sup></a> There can be no doubt that they were equally
common in the neighbouring island groups, but no literary
antiquary possessed of the requisite knowledge seems to have
visited Shetland and Orkney in time to rescue them from
oblivion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The curious literary fragment, taken down phonetically
by Low, who was completely ignorant of the language, is
plainly akin to the old Scandinavian <i>Kæmpeviser</i>. The story
is based on the <i>Sörlathattr</i>, one of the scenes of which is laid
in the island of Hoy. The main incidents of the older poem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxiv'>cxiv</span>are as follow:—Hedin, a prince of Serkland, had sworn
mutual brotherhood with Hogni, King of Denmark. Nothing
occurred to disturb their friendship until Hogni went on a
war expedition. Hedin, wandering in the woods, fell in with
a sorceress, from whom he received a magic philtre to enable
him to win the love of Hilda, Hogni’s daughter. The result
was that he ran off with her in a splendid ship belonging to
Hogni, and made for Serkland. When Hogni came home he
set off in pursuit, and came up with them at the island of
Hoy. There they both landed with their men, and a furious
battle commenced. Odin (who enjoyed a good fight) cast a
spell upon the combatants, so that they were obliged to fight on
without ceasing, until a Christian should come who should
have the hardihood to mingle in the fray, of which Hilda
was doomed to be all the time an agonised spectator. At
last Olaf Tryggvi’s son came to the Orkneys, and Ivar Liomi,
one of his men who landed in Hoy, went into the fight and
broke the spell, killed Hedin and Hogni, and bore off the
prize.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c017'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The story of the Shetland ballad is that Hiluge, a young
nobleman at the court of Norway, made love to the king’s
daughter Hildina, and was rejected by her, though her father
supported his pretensions to her hand. When the king and
Hiluge were away at the wars, an Earl of Orkney came to
Norway, and found such favour with Hildina that she consented
to fly with him to the Orkneys. When the king and
Hiluge returned and discovered what had happened in their
absence, they set sail, with a great host, in pursuit of the
fugitives. Hildina persuaded the earl to go unarmed to meet
her father, and ask for his pardon and peace. The king was
pleased to forgive him, and to grant his consent to their union.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxv'>cxv</span>But now Hiluge, by artfully working on the king’s mind, stirs
up his latent wrath against the earl, and induces him to
revoke his consent. The result is, that he decides that Hiluge
and the earl shall meet in single combat, and fight it out to the
death of one or other. Hiluge was victorious; and, not content
with the death of his enemy, he cut off his head and cast
it into Hildina’s lap with taunting words. Hildina answered
his taunts boldly, and conceived a bloody revenge. But she
must now follow him to Norway, where he renewed his courtship.
Ere long she seemed to relent, and gave him her promise,
but besought her father to grant her this boon, that she herself
should fill out the first wine-cup at the bridal. Her
request was granted. The guests came, the feast was set, and
Hildina filled up the wine-cups for them. The wine was
drugged, and they were all cast into a deep sleep, from which
nothing could awake them. Hildina now caused her father
to be carried forth, and set fire to the house. Hiluge, awaking
in the midst of the burning, cried out for mercy. Hildina
replied that she would give him the same mercy as he had
given to her earl, and left him to perish in the flames.</p>

<div id='i-cxvi'  class='figleft id012'>
<img src='images/cxvi.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>The dialect of the ballad resembles that which prevailed
in Norway in the middle of the 15th century, but presents
several peculiarities of local origin. The allusions in it to St.
Magnus show that it cannot be older than the 12th century
in its present form, although the story of Hedin and Hogni,
on which it appears to have been founded, belongs to the
heathen time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Looking at the number of Runic monuments in the island
of Man,<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c017'><sup>[213]</sup></a> and the beauty of their workmanship, it certainly
seems surprising that none of these characteristic works of
northern art should have survived in the Orkneys.<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c017'><sup>[214]</sup></a> Previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxvi'>cxvi</span>to the discovery of the inscriptions in Maeshow, the only
Rune-inscribed monument known within the
bounds of the ancient earldom was the stone
in the churchyard of Crosskirk, Northmavine,
Shetland, described by Low, which reads
(according to his imperfect copy) “Bid pray
for the soul of ——,” and consequently
belongs to the Christian time. That there
were similar monuments in other places, however,
is shown by the recent discovery of a
Runic fragment at Aithsvoe, Cunningsburgh,
Shetland.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c017'><sup>[215]</sup></a> It is a mere fragment of the terminal
part of a monumental inscription, incised
on the edge of the stone, consisting of
the letters KVIMIK, which Professor Stephens
reads as the concluding part of the customary
formula, “—— hewed me,” <i>i.e.</i> carved this stone.</p>

<p class='c008'>But perhaps the most interesting and suggestive
remains of the Northmen are those
that have been from time to time recovered
from the soil which they made their own—the
relics which were actually possessed by
the men and women of the Saga time; the
weapons they used, and the ornaments they
wore. In the grave-mounds of the heathen
period, the warrior Viking still lies as he was
laid, with his shield at his shoulder, and his
sword ready to his hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sword here figured, which is of a distinctively
Scandinavian type, was dug up
in making the railway near Gorton, in
Morayshire, and is now in the museum of the Society of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxvii'>cxvii</span>Antiquaries of Scotland. It is 35 inches in length, of excellent
workmanship, damascened along the centre of the blade,
and the pommel and recurved guard are beautifully inlaid
with silver. A number of fragments of shield-bosses and
broken swords, from Orkney graves, are also in the museum.
The swords are chiefly of the older form, with straight guard
and massive square or triangular pommel. In one of the
interments at Westray the scabbard-tip here figured was
found, and in others the bones of the dog and horse were
found along with the human skeleton, indicating the continuance
in Orkney of the sepulchral rites which prevailed in the
heathen time in Norway.</p>

<div id='i-cxvii'  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/cxvii.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>For at least a century and a half after the establishment
of the Norse earldom in Orkney and Shetland, the heathen
Norsemen practised the burial customs which they had
brought with them from Norway. Sigurd, Eystein’s son, the
first Earl of Orkney, was buried in a cairn on Ekkialsbakki,
(and his grave-mound was known as Sigurd’s How (<i>Siwardhoch</i>)
in the 12th century,<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c017'><sup>[216]</sup></a>) and Torf Einar caused his men
to rear a cairn over the remains of Halfdan Hálegg, the son
of Harald Harfagri, whom he offered to Odin in Rinansey.</p>

<p class='c008'>A vivid picture of the ceremonies attending the burial of
a Norse chief of the 10th century is preserved in the narrative
of an eye-witness, in the work of an Arab geographer;<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c017'><sup>[217]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxviii'>cxviii</span>all its details are amply confirmed by the contents of the
grave-mounds of the period. Ahmed Ibn Fozlan, being in
the country on the upper part of the Volga (then occupied
by the Norsemen), as ambassador from the Caliph Al
Moktader (<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 907-932), resolved to see for himself whether
what he had heard of their burial customs was true. A
great chief among the Norsemen had just died, and Ibn
Fozlan describes, with curious minuteness of detail, the
strange things he witnessed on the occasion. He gives a
most characteristic picture of the drinking habits of the
Northmen. “This nation,” he says, “is much given to wine
and drink, by day and night, and it is not uncommon for one
or another of them to die with beakers in their hands.
When a chieftain dies, his family ask his maids (concubines)
and men-servants, ‘Which of you will die with him?’ One
of them will say, ‘I,’ and by this promise he is bound, and
cannot revoke it. If he should desire to do so, he is not
permitted.” It is mostly the maids who are willing to be
thus sacrificed, says Ibn Fozlan, and on this occasion it was
one of them who offered to die with her lord. She was
accordingly given in charge to the other servants, who were
to indulge her in every wish till the day of her sacrifice;
and he adds, that “every day she drank, sang, was lively
and merry.” Meantime the dead man had been laid in a
temporary grave, and strong drink, fruits, and musical
instruments placed beside him, as if to relieve the tedium of
his confinement until the completion of the preparations for
the funeral rites. A splendid suit of clothing was prepared
for him, his ship was hauled up on the strand, and placed
on four posts erected for the purpose. A bed was prepared
in the midst of the deck, with a tent-like canopy over it, and
covered with gold-embroidered cloth. In the preparation of
this bed there comes on the scene an old hag, “whom they
called the dead man’s angel.” It was she who took charge
of the making of the dead man’s clothing and all needful
arrangements, and she it was also who was to put the girl to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxix'>cxix</span>death. “I saw her,” says Ibn Fozlan; “she was sallow and
stern.” While the “dead man’s angel” was arranging the
bed, the multitude were away at the temporary grave,
disinterring the corpse. They clothed him in the rich
garments provided for the occasion, and then bore him to the
ship, where he was laid in state under the canopy. “So
they laid him on the mattress, and stayed him up with
pillows, then brought the strong drink, the fruits, and odoriferous
herbs, and set them by his side, placing bread, meat,
and onions also before him. Then came a man forward with
a dog, hewed it into two portions, and cast them into the
ship. So brought they all the dead man’s weapons and laid
them by his side. Then they led forth two horses, made
them run till they were covered with sweat, then hewed
them in pieces with the sword, and cast the flesh into the
ship. So also they brought forth two oxen, hewed them in
pieces, and cast them into the ship. Next they came with a
cock and hen, slew them, and cast them also into the ship.”
In the meantime the woman who was to die kept going
backwards and forwards in and out of the tent. At last
they led her away to an object which they had made in the
form of the framework of a door—two posts, with a cross
piece on the top, or, as is suggested, a substitute for a
trilithon. “She set her feet on the palms of men’s hands,
stepped up on the frame, and said some words in their
tongue, after which they made her stand down. Then they
lifted her up a second and third time, and she went through
the same ceremony. Now they handed her a hen, the head
of which she cut off and cast away, but the body they cast
into the ship. I asked my interpreter what it was that the
woman had said. He answered, she said the first time, ‘Lo!
I see my father and my mother;’ the second time, ‘Lo!
here I see seated all my deceased relations;’ the third time,
‘Lo! here I see my master seated in paradise—paradise,
beautiful and green, my master surrounded by his men and
his menials; he calls for me; bring me to him.’ Thereupon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxx'>cxx</span>they conveyed her to the ship. She took the bracelets from
her arms, and gave them to the crone whom they called ‘the
dead man’s angel;’ and the rings from her ankles, and gave
them to the two young girls who had attended her, and who
were ‘the dead man’s angel’s daughters.’ Then came men
with shields and staves, and brought her a beaker of strong
drink. She sang a song, and drank it out. Folk said to me
that she thereby took leave of her friends. They reached her
a second beaker. She took it, and sang a long time. The
old hag bade her hasten to empty it, and go into the tent
where her dead master was. I watched her; she was out of
herself. In attempting to go into the tent she stuck by the
head in the space between the tent and the ship. The old
hag caught hold of her by the head and dragged her in with
her, while the men commenced to beat their shields with the
staves, that her shrieks might not be heard, and so frighten
other girls, and make them unwilling to die with their lords.”
The sequel is too horrible to be given as it stands in the old
Arab’s plain-spoken narrative. A cord was finally wound
round her neck, at the ends of which two men pulled, while the
“dead man’s angel” stabbed her to the heart with a broad-bladed
knife. Then the relatives of the dead man set fire to
the pile. A storm that was just beginning to rage fanned the
flames, and drove them aloft to a great height. A Norseman
who was standing by said to Ibn Fozlan “You Arabs are fools.
You take the man whom you most have loved and honoured,
and put him down into the earth, where vermin and worms
devour him. We, on the contrary, burn him up in a twinkling,
and he goes straight to paradise.” After the pile was consumed
to ashes they raised a great-mound over the spot, and
set up on it a pillar made of a tree-trunk, on which they carved
the names of the dead man and of their king.</p>

<p class='c008'>The burial usages, however, were not always the same.
Great men were buried with the pomp and ceremony befitting
their rank, while meaner men were simply reduced to ashes
and inhumed in a clay urn, or in a stone pot, not unfrequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxxi'>cxxi</span>in the stone cooking-kettle that had served them when in
life.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c017'><sup>[218]</sup></a> This burial in stone urns, or in cooking vessels of
steatite, is of common occurrence in the grave-mounds of
the Viking period in Norway, and is also not unfrequently
found in Orkney and Shetland.</p>

<div id='i-cxxi'  class='figcenter id013'>
<img src='images/cxxi.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Associated with such burials in Norway there are occasionally
found the peculiar brooches which are characteristic
of the later Pagan time.<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c017'><sup>[219]</sup></a> Although they occur perhaps more
frequently with unburnt burials, they link on with the
custom of cremation. Thus they afford a valuable index to the
chronology of these remains in Scotland, because the Pagan
period of the Scandinavian occupation may be said to be
limited to the time between the expedition of Harald Harfagri
and the battle of Clontarf (872-1014). These brooches
are found in Scandinavian graves of this period, in Scotland,
England, Ireland, Normandy, Russia, and Iceland—in short,
wherever the heathen Vikings effected a settlement. In
Scotland they have been found in various places—in Sutherland,
in Caithness, in Orkney, in the Hebrides, and even in
remote St. Kilda. The specimen here figured, which is now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxxii'>cxxii</span>in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland is
one of a pair found in a stone cist on a mound which covered
the remains of a “Pictish Tower” at Castletown in Caithness.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c017'><sup>[220]</sup></a>
They are usually found in pairs, one near each shoulder of the
skeleton. This corresponds with the statement of an ancient
Arab writer, that the Norse women used to wear such brooches
in pairs on their breasts.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c017'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<div id='i-cxxii'  class='figcenter id009'>
<img src='images/cxxii.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>The most remarkable discovery of these characteristic
Scandinavian interments that has hitherto occurred in Scotland
was made in the island of Westray, Orkney, in 1849, by
Mr. William Rendall.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c017'><sup>[222]</sup></a> A number of graves were found in
the sandy links near Pierowall (the Hofn of the Saga), in
some of which were swords and shield-bosses, indicating that
the skeletons were those of men. But in one a pair of tortoise
or shell-shaped brooches and a trefoil ornament were the only
objects found with the skeleton. In another, a pair of these
brooches were found on the breast, and a pair of combs, of the
form here figured, lay on either side of the neck, apparently
as they had fallen out of the hair. In a third, a pair of
brooches, a pair of combs, and a bronze pin, were found. It
appears from these examples that the brooches undoubtedly
belonged to women, and that the warriors were usually buried
with sword and shield and “panoply of war;” and, as we read
in Ibn Fozlan’s account, the dog and the horse of the
deceased appear also to have been sacrificed at the grave, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_cxxiii'>cxxiii</span>interred with him, in Orkney as well as on the banks of the
Volga.</p>

<p class='c008'>But we meet with few memorials of the daily life of the
Norsemen beyond those which have been buried with them
in the early period of their occupation of the Islands. Christianity
abolished the custom of burying such relics with the
dead, and for the remains of the Christian period we must
look to the yet unexcavated sites of the <i>skális</i> and homesteads
of which we read in the Saga. It would be equally interesting
to the archæologist, and instructive to the historian, to be able
to compare the relics from such sites as those of Kolbein
Hruga’s castle in Weir, the castle of which Blán was the
keeper in Damsey, or the <i>skáli</i> of Swein Asleifson at Langskail
in Gairsay, with the extensive collections obtained in
recent years from the “Pictish Towers” of Orkney, which
have given us such suggestive glimpses of the domestic life of
the period preceding the Norse occupation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It gives a curious feeling of reality to the ancient legends
when we can thus handle the blades and bucklers of which
we read such stirring stories, and remember that it was because
the Norse sword was then the longest, and the Norse
arm the strongest, that we now read the earliest chapters
of the history of northern Scotland in the guise of an Iceland
Saga.</p>

<h3 id='ch-i' class='c016'>CHAPTER I.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE EARLS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'>It is said that the Orkney Islands were colonised in the
days of Harald the Fairhaired,<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c017'><sup>[223]</sup></a> but previously they were a
station for Vikings.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c017'><sup>[224]</sup></a></p>
<p class='c008'>The first Earl of the Orkneys was called Sigurd. He
was the son of Eystein Glumra (the loud-talking), and
brother of Rögnvald, Earl of Moeri.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c017'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>After Sigurd his son Guttorm ruled one year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Torf-Einar,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c017'><sup>[226]</sup></a> son of Earl Rögnvald, succeeded him. He
was a man of great power, and was Earl a long time.
Hálfdán Hálegg<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c017'><sup>[227]</sup></a> (high-legs) made an expedition against
Torf-Einar, and drove him from the Orkneys. Einar
returned, and slew Hálfdán in Rinansey.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c017'><sup>[228]</sup></a> Thereupon King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Harald brought an army over to the Orkneys. Then Einar
fled to Scotland. King Harald made the Orkneymen swear
oaths of fealty to him for themselves and all their possessions.
The Earl and King Harald were afterwards reconciled.
He became the King’s man, and held the land as a
fief from him. He had, however, no tribute to pay, as
there was much predatory warfare then in the islands; but
he paid the king sixty marks of gold<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c017'><sup>[229]</sup></a> (once for all). After
this, King Harald made a raid on Scotland, as is told in the
Glumdrapa.<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c017'><sup>[230]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>After Torf-Einar, Arnkell, Erlend, and Thorfinn Hausakliuf
(skull-splitter), his sons, succeeded him. In their
days Eirik Blódöx<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c017'><sup>[231]</sup></a> (bloody axe) came over from Norway,
and the Earls were his vassals. Arnkell and Erlend fell in
battle,<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c017'><sup>[232]</sup></a> but Thorfinn governed the land and became an old
man. His sons were Arnfid, Hávard, Lödver, Ljót, and
Skúli; their mother was Grélaug, daughter of Earl Dungad
(Duncan) in Caithness.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c017'><sup>[233]</sup></a> Her mother was Gróa, daughter of
Thorstein the Red.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the days of Earl Thorfinn the sons of Eirik Blódöx
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>arrived from Norway, when they had fled from Earl Hákon,
and they did many deeds of violence in the islands. Earl
Thorfinn died on a sickbed, and his sons, of whom there are
extensive histories, succeeded him. Lödver survived his
brothers, and ruled the land alone.  His son was Earl
Sigurd the Stout; he was a powerful man, and a great
warrior.</p>

<p class='c008'>In his days Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, returning from a viking
expedition to the west, came to the Orkneys with his men,
and seized Earl Sigurd in Rörvág,<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c017'><sup>[234]</sup></a> as he lay there with a
single ship. King Olaf offered the Earl to ransom his life
on condition that he should embrace the true faith and be
baptized; that he should become his man, and proclaim
Christianity over all the Orkneys. He took his son Hundi
or Hvelp (whelp) as a hostage, and left the Orkneys for
Norway, where he became King; and Hundi stayed with
him some years, and died there.</p>

<p class='c008'>After that Earl Sigurd paid no allegiance to King Olaf.
He married the daughter of Malcolm, King of Scots,<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c017'><sup>[235]</sup></a> and
their son was Earl Thorfinn; his elder sons [by a former
marriage] were Sumarlidi, Brúsi, and Einar.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Five years after the death of King Olaf, Tryggvi’s son,<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c017'><sup>[236]</sup></a>
Earl Sigurd went to Ireland. He set his elder sons over
his domains, and sent Thorfinn to the King of Scots, his
mother’s father. While on this expedition Sigurd was
killed in Brian’s battle;<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c017'><sup>[237]</sup></a> and as soon as the news came to
the Orkneys his sons Sumarlidi, Brúsi, and Einar, were
accepted as Earls, and they divided the islands among them,
each taking one third.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorfinn was five winters old when their father fell.
When the King of Scots heard of the Earl’s death he
bestowed Caithness and Sutherland upon his grandson, with
the title of Earl, and gave him men to rule the domain along
with him. Earl Thorfinn was very precocious in the
maturity of all his powers. He was of large stature and
strong, but ungainly. As he grew up it soon became apparent
that he was avaricious, harsh, and cruel, yet a very
clever man.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brothers Einar and Brúsi were different in their dispositions.
Brúsi was clever and fond of company, eloquent
and beloved. Einar was stubborn and taciturn, disagreeable
and avaricious, yet a great warrior. Sumarlidi was like
Brúsi in his disposition. He was the eldest, and the most
short-lived of the brothers. He died on a sickbed.</p>

<p class='c008'>After his death Thorfinn demanded his share of [Sumarlidi’s
portion of] the Orkneys, although he already had
Caithness and Sutherland which had belonged to his father
Sigurd. This Einar considered to be much more than a
third of the Orkneys, and he would not give up any part of
them to Thorfinn. Brúsi, however, consented to give up
his share [of the portion belonging to Sumarlidi], saying that
he did not covet more of the land than his own proper third.
Then Einar took possession of two shares of the islands.
He became then a powerful man, and had a large number
of retainers. In the summer he made war expeditions,
calling out great levies of his men from their homes;
but these expeditions were not always successful, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Bœndr<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c017'><sup>[238]</sup></a> began to grow tired of them, but the Earl exacted all
his services with violence, and did not suffer any one to speak
against them. He was indeed a man of the greatest
violence. Then there arose great scarcity in the islands on
account of the labour and large expense to which the Bœndr
were thus subjected. However, in the parts belonging to
Brúsi there were good seasons and easy life, and he was
greatly liked by the Bœndr.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>There</span> was a powerful and wealthy man, by name Amundi,

man in all the Orkneys.</p>

<p class='c008'>One spring the Earl called out the Bœndr as usual, but
they murmured greatly, and brought their grievances before
Amundi, and asked him to say a good word for them to the
Earl. He replied that the Earl was not disposed to listen
to advice, and it would be of no avail to ask him to do this,
as he and the Earl were such good friends; he further said
that, from what he knew of his own temper and that of the
Earl, there was great danger that they might become enemies,
and he would have nothing to do with the matter. Then
they asked Thorkel, and he was very reluctant, although
at last he yielded to their solicitations, but Amundi thought
he had been too rash to promise.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Earl held a meeting (Thing)<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c017'><sup>[240]</sup></a> Thorkel spoke
on behalf of the Bœndr. He begged the Earl to spare the
people, and told him of their distress. The Earl answered
blandly, and said he would give great weight to Thorkel’s
words. “I had intended,” he said, “to take out six ships,
but now I shall not take more than three; but thou, Thorkel,
do not ask this of me a second time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bœndr were very grateful to Thorkel for his assistance,
and the Earl made an expedition during the summer,
and again in the autumn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next spring the Earl again called out his men, and held
a meeting with the Bœndr. Thorkel spoke again on their
behalf, and begged the Earl to spare them. The Earl became
wroth, and said that for his speech the lot of the Bœndr
should be far worse than before. Then he became so mad
with rage, that he said that one or other of them should not
leave the meeting unhurt, and immediately dissolved the
meeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Amundi heard what Thorkel and the Earl had
said to each other, he bade his son go abroad, and Thorkel
went to Earl Thorfinn in Caithness. He stayed there a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>time, and became foster-father to the Earl, who was still
young. From that time he was called Thorkel Fóstri, and
became a man of great repute. Other men of note and
influence fled from the Orkneys on account of Earl Einar’s
violence; some to Earl Thorfinn, some to Norway, and some
to other countries.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Earl Thorfinn came to man’s estate, he sent to his
brother Einar, and demanded from him what he considered
his share of the Orkneys. Einar was not inclined to divide
his possessions: so, when Earl Thorfinn heard this, he called
out men from Caithness, and set out for the Orkneys. When
Earl Einar had news of this, he collected an army, with the
intent to defend his possessions. Earl Brúsi also collected
an army, and went to meet them, and tried to reconcile them;
and peace was made on condition that Thorfinn should have
one-third of the Orkneys as his own proper share.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Brúsi and Einar joined their portions, on the footing
that the latter should rule them and defend them for both,
and that he who survived the other should inherit his portion.
But this compact was thought unfair, as Brúsi had a son, by
name Rögnvald, and Einar had no son. Thorfinn appointed
his own deputies to manage his possessions in the islands,
but he himself lived for the most part in Caithness.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the summer Einar went on expeditions to Ireland,
Scotland, and Bretland (Wales). One summer, when ravaging
Ireland, he fought in Ulfreksfiord<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c017'><sup>[241]</sup></a> with Konufögr,<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c017'><sup>[242]</sup></a> an Irish
king, and was defeated, with a heavy loss of men. The next
summer Eyvind Urarhorn<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c017'><sup>[243]</sup></a> (bull’s horn) came from Ireland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>on his way to Norway, and being overtaken by a violent gale,
he turned his ships into Asmundarvag,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c017'><sup>[244]</sup></a> and lay there for a
while. When Earl Einar heard this, he went thither with
many men, seized Eyvind, and caused him to be killed, but
gave quarter to most of his followers. They went to Norway
in the autumn, and when they met King Olaf,<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c017'><sup>[245]</sup></a> they told
him of Eyvind’s murder. He said little about it, but it was
afterwards found that he considered this a great loss and a
serious offence against himself, though he never said much
about things with which he was displeased.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Thorfinn sent Thorkel Fóstri to collect his revenues,
but Earl Einar regarded it as chiefly owing to Thorkel that
Earl Thorfinn had come into [his possessions in] the Islands.
Thorkel left the islands suddenly, and went to Ness (Caithness).
He told Earl Thorfinn that he had become aware
that Earl Einar had intended to kill him, if his relatives
and friends had not given him warning. “And now,” he
added, “I will avoid the risk of having such a meeting
with the Earl as shall bring matters to a crisis between us,
and I will go farther away, where his power does not reach
me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorfinn persuaded him to go to King Olaf, in Norway,
and spend the winter with him in great friendship; “for you
will,” he said, “be highly esteemed wherever you come among
noble men; but I know your temper and that of the Earl to
be such that you will not long refrain from hostilities.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorkel then prepared for his departure, and in the
autumn he went to Norway to visit King Olaf, and spent
the winter with him in great friendship. The King often
sought Thorkel’s advice, because he considered him a wise
man and a weighty counsellor, and such was the truth. In
telling of the Earls, the King found that he was very partial,
a great friend of Thorfinn, and an enemy of Earl Einar.
Early in the spring the King sent a ship with a message to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Earl Thorfinn, asking him to come and see him; and the
Earl did not put off the journey, for protestations of friendship
had accompanied the message.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THORKEL SLAYS EARL EINAR.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Thorfinn</span> went east to King Olaf in Norway, where he was
well received, and spent the summer there; and when he
prepared to go westward again, King Olaf gave him a large
and excellent war-ship, fully equipped. Thorkel Fóstri went
with the Earl, who gave him the ship in which he had come
from the west in the summer. The King and the Earl
parted great friends.</p>
<p class='c008'>In the autumn Earl Thorfinn came to the Orkneys.
When Earl Einar heard of it, he stayed with many men in
his ships. Brúsi went to meet the two brothers, and tried
to reconcile them; and once more they made peace and confirmed
it with oaths. Thorkel Fóstri should be pardoned,
and be a friend of Earl Einar, and each of them should give
the other a banquet, and the Earl should first come to Thorkel
at Sandvik.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c017'><sup>[246]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>When Einar came, he and his men were most sumptuously
treated, yet the Earl was not cheerful. The banqueting
hall was a large one, with doors at each end. When the
Earl was going away, Thorkel was to accompany him, and
he sent men to examine the way by which they were to go.
When they returned, they said they had discovered three
divisions of armed men in ambush, and were certain that
foul play was intended. Upon hearing this, Thorkel delayed
starting, and called his men together. The Earl asked him
to make himself ready, and said it was now time to go.
Thorkel replied that he had many things to see to, and
kept going out and in.</p>

<p class='c008'>There were fires on the floor, and Thorkel walked about,
and once when he entered by one of the doors he was followed
by an Icelander, by name Hallvard, from the east of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Iceland, who shut the door after him. As Thorkel passed
between the fire and where the Earl sat, the latter said:
“Are you ready now?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorkel replied: “I am ready now,” and struck the
Earl a blow on the head, so that he fell forward on the floor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hallvard said: “I never saw people with so little presence
of mind as you who are here. Why do you not take
the Earl out of the fire?”</p>

<p class='c008'>With his axe he again struck the Earl on the back of the
head, and pulled him towards the bench. Then Thorkel
and his men walked out quickly by the door opposite to
that by which he had entered, and there, outside the door,
were the rest of his men fully armed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl’s men took hold of their master and found that
he was dead. They were too much stupified to take revenge,
as the thing was done so suddenly, and no one expected such
a deed from Thorkel; besides, the Earl’s men were mostly
without arms, and many of them were good friends of Thorkel’s
before. Thus Thorkel had to thank his good fortune
that he enjoyed a longer life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl’s men went away, and Thorkel to his ship.
In a few days, shortly after the beginning of the winter, he
left for the east, and arrived safely in Norway. He went
immediately to see King Olaf, who received him very
graciously, and felt much pleasure at his deed; and with
him Thorkel spent the winter.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL BRÚSI.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> the death of Earl Einar, Earl Brúsi took possession
of that portion of the domain which had belonged to his
brother (Einar), for there had been many witnesses to the
compact which they had made. Thorfinn thought it right
that they should each have one-half of the Islands, yet Brúsi
had two-thirds that year. Next year Thorfinn demanded
one-half, to which Brúsi did not consent, and they had many
meetings about it. Their friends tried to settle matters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>between them, but Thorfinn would not take anything less
than half of the Islands.</p>
<p class='c008'>Brúsi said: “I was satisfied with that third part which I
inherited from my father, and no one claimed it from me, and
I have inherited a second third after my brother according to
a lawful agreement; and although I am unable to contend
with you, brother, I will have recourse to other means than
giving up my lands and title at present.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the meeting ended. But Brúsi saw that he had no
strength to hold his own against Thorfinn, because he had
much larger possessions, and, besides, some hope of assistance
from his grandfather, the King of Scots. He therefore
resolved to go to Olaf, King of Norway, taking with him his
son Rögnvald, who was then ten years old. The King
received him well, and he told him his business and
explained to him how matters stood between him and his
brother, and begged his assistance to keep his possessions,
offering in return his full friendship.</p>

<p class='c008'>The King replied by stating that Harald the Fairhaired
had reserved to himself all odal rights<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c017'><sup>[247]</sup></a> in the Orkneys, and
that the Earls since that time always held those lands as
fiefs, and never as their own.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is a proof of this,” he said, “that when Eirik
Blódöx and his sons were in the Orkneys, the Earls were
their vassals; and when Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, my kinsman,
came there, your father, Earl Sigurd, became his man.
Now, I have succeeded to the entire heritage of Olaf,
Tryggvi’s son. I will give you the islands as a fief, on
condition that you become my man, and then I will try
whether my help will not be of more avail to you than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>aid and assistance of the King of Scots to your brother
Thorfinn. But if you will not accept these terms, I will try
to recover the possessions and dominion which my kinsmen
have inherited and possessed there in the west.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl considered these words thoughtfully, and sought
the advice of his friends as to whether he should consent to
King Olaf’s terms and become his man. “I do not see,” he
said, “how matters will go with me at our parting if I refuse,
because the King has made an unequivocal claim, and regards
the Islands as his property. Now, considering his great
power, and the circumstance that we are here, he will have
no scruples in making my case such as he likes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, although the Earl had objections to both alternatives,
he resolved to give up all, himself and his dominions,
into the King’s power. Then King Olaf asserted his suzerainty
over all his hereditary possessions, and the Earl
became his man, and confirmed this compact with oaths.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Thorfinn heard that his brother Brúsi had gone east
to King Olaf to solicit his assistance; but as he had himself
seen the King before, and secured his friendship, he thought
that his case had been well prepared there, and he knew that
many would advocate his cause. Nevertheless, he resolved
to prepare to go to Norway as quickly as possible, intending
that he should arrive there very nearly at the same time with
his brother, so that he might see the King himself before his
brother had concluded his business. This, however, turned
out otherwise than the Earl intended, for he did not see King
Olaf until the treaty between Earl Brúsi and the King was
fully concluded; and he did not know that Earl Brúsi had
given up his dominions until he came to the King.</p>

<p class='c008'>At their first interview the King made the same claim
to the dominion of the Orkneys which he had made before
to Earl Brúsi; and he made the same request of Thorfinn—namely,
that he should acknowledge the King’s suzerainty
over his portion of the islands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl gave a courteous answer to this demand, saying:
“I consider your friendship of great importance; and if you
think you require my assistance against other chiefs, you
have well deserved it; but I cannot well pay you homage,
as I am already an Earl of the King of Scots, and his vassal.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>But when the King found from these words that the
Earl wished to avoid the claims which he had put forward,
he said: “If you will not become my man, there is the other
alternative—viz., that I place that man over the Islands
whom I choose. But I wish you to promise me with oaths
not to claim those lands, and to leave him in peace whom I
place over them. Now, if you will not accept any of those
conditions, he who governs the land will say that hostilities
may be expected from you, and in that case you must not
think it strange if a dale meets a hill.”<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c017'><sup>[248]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl answered by requesting time to consider these
matters. The King gave him time, and permission to consult
with his friends; but then the Earl asked the King for
a further delay to the next summer, so that he might go
home; “for,” said he, “my counsellors are at home, and my
judgment is not yet mature on account of my age.” The
King told him to make his choice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorkel Fóstri was with the King at the time, and he
sent a message to the Earl secretly, telling him that whatever
else his intentions were he should not think of parting with
the King without being reconciled to him for the present, as
he had got him in his power. Now the Earl thought there
was no alternative but to let the King have his will, although
he did not consider it by any means a desirable thing to
relinquish all hope of his patrimony, and to promise with
oaths to leave those in undisturbed possession of his dominions
who had no hereditary right to them. But because he
was not certain about his departure (if he refused), he chose
to submit to the King, and to become his man, as Brúsi his
brother had previously done.</p>

<p class='c008'>The King perceived that Thorfinn was a man of much
stronger will than Brúsi, and distrusted him therefore more.
He saw that Thorfinn would think himself sufficiently
powerful, with the aid of the King of Scots, though he broke
this treaty; and the King was sagacious enough to perceive
that, while Brúsi agreed to everything sincerely, and made
only such promises as he intended to keep, Thorfinn agreed
cheerfully to everything, while at the same time he had
resolved within himself what course he would take; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>though he made no objections to anything which the King
proposed, yet the King suspected that he intended to act
upon their agreements afterwards in his own way.</p>
<h3 id='ch-v' class='c001'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE EARLS BRÚSI AND THORFINN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> King Olaf had considered all these matters, he had a
general meeting summoned by the blowing of a trumpet, to
which the Earls were also called.</p>
<p class='c008'>The King said: “I will now make publicly known the
treaty between me and the Earls of the Orkneys. They have
acknowledged my suzerainty over all the Orkneys and
Hjaltland (Shetland), promising to become my men, and
confirming these their promises with oaths. In return, I
will give to Brúsi one-third of the land, and to Thorfinn
another third, which they had before; but the last third,
which belonged to Earl Einar, I adjudge to be forfeited to
me, because he slew Eyvind Urarhorn, my henchman<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c017'><sup>[249]</sup></a> and
beloved comrade. Of this portion I will dispose as I shall
think fit; and I make it a condition with you, my Earls,
that you be reconciled to Thorkel Amundi’s son concerning
your brother Einar’s slaying, and I wish to act as an arbitrator
between you if you agree to this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earls consented to this, as to everything else which
the King proposed. Then Thorkel stepped forward and
submitted his case to the King’s decision, after which the
meeting was dissolved. King Olaf awarded a weregild<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c017'><sup>[250]</sup></a> for
Earl Einar as for three Lendermen; one-third, however,
should be remitted in consideration of the Earl’s guilt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Thorfinn asked permission to depart, and when he
had obtained it, he made himself ready in great haste. One
day, when all was ready, and the Earl was drinking on board
his ship, Thorkel, Amundi’s son, came and laid his head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>on the Earl’s knees, and asked him to do with it what he
liked.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said: “Why do you do this? We are reconciled
according to the King’s arbitration; arise.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He rose and said: “I will abide by the King’s arbitration
concerning differences between me and Brúsi; but, as
far as you are concerned, I leave everything to you. Although
the King has reserved for me possessions and safety in the
Orkneys, I am so well acquainted with your disposition that
I know it would be impossible for me to go there unless I
have your confidence; and I will promise you never to go to
the Orkneys, whatever the King says.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied slowly, and said: “Would you rather
have me to adjust our affairs than abide by the King’s decision?
If so, I make it the first condition that you shall go
with me to the Orkneys, and remain with me, and not leave
me except with my permission; that you shall be in duty
bound to defend my land, and to do everything I wish to
have done while we are both alive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorkel replied: “I leave this to you, like everything
else that concerns me.” Thereupon he submitted his case to
the Earl’s decision.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said he would fix the money payment [for his
brother’s death] afterwards, and received oaths from Thorkel
according to their agreement; and Thorkel prepared to go
with him. The Earl left as soon as he was ready, and he
and King Olaf never met afterwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Brúsi remained behind, and prepared for his departure
more leisurely. Before he left, King Olaf had an
interview with him, and said: “I think it advisable to make
you my confidential agent in the western parts. I intend to
give you two-thirds of the islands, which you had before,
because I do not wish you to have less power, now that you
are my man, than you had before; and as a pledge of my
good faith, I will keep your son Rögnvald with me. I see
that with two-thirds of the land and my assistance you may
well hold your own against Earl Thorfinn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Brúsi was thankful for two-thirds of the land. He
stayed a little while yet before he left, and came west to the
Islands (the Orkneys) in the autumn. His son Rögnvald
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>remained with King Olaf. These facts are mentioned by
Ottar Svarti (the swarthy):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Readily these noble people</div>

      <div class='line'>Hjaltlanders! your fame is well known.</div>
      <div class='line'>Till we had thee, fierce in battle,</div>
      <div class='line'>To these eastern shores, there was not</div>
      <div class='line'>Any prince on earth who conquered</div>
      <div class='line'>Those far distant western islands.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>When the brothers Thorfinn and Brúsi came west to the
Islands, Brúsi took possession of two-thirds of the domain,
and Thorfinn of one, but he was all the time in Caithness, in
Scotland, and placed deputies over the islands. Brúsi alone
had to defend them, for they were in those times very much
exposed to the ravages of Norwegians and Danes, who called
there on their viking expeditions to the west, and plundered
in the outlying parts. Brúsi made complaints to his brother
Thorfinn on account of his not contributing anything to the
defence of the Orkneys or Hjaltland (Shetland), although he
received his full share of all the land-dues and revenues.
Then Thorfinn proposed to Brúsi to take two-thirds of the
Islands, undertaking the defence of the whole, and leave
Brúsi one-third. Although this division did not take place
immediately, yet it is said in the History of the Earls that
it did take place, and that Thorfinn had two-thirds of the
Islands, and Brúsi one-third, when Canute the Great conquered
Norway, after the flight of King Olaf.</p>

<p class='c008'>King Olaf, Harald’s son, received no homage from Earl
Thorfinn after he made the treaty with him and Brúsi.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Thorfinn now became a powerful chief. He was
a man of very large stature, uncomely, sharp-featured, dark-haired,
and sallow and swarthy in his complexion. Yet
he was a most martial-looking man, and of great energy;
greedy of wealth and of renown; bold and successful in
war, and a great strategist. He was five years old when
he received the title of Earl and the revenues of Caithness
from King Malcolm,<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c017'><sup>[251]</sup></a> his grandfather, and fourteen when he
went forth from his own territory on maritime expeditions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and attacked the possessions of other chiefs.  So says
Arnór Jarlaskáld (the Earls’ poet):</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By the prince in storm of helmets</div>

      <div class='line'>Under heaven a braver leader</div>
      <div class='line'>Ne’er was found than Einar’s brother.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Earl Thorfinn was greatly supported by the King of
Scots. This assistance being so near, it much increased
his power in the Orkneys.</p>

<p class='c008'>The King of Scots died after the reconciliation of the
brothers. Karl Hundason<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c017'><sup>[252]</sup></a> took the kingdom in Scotland.
He considered Caithness to belong to him, as to the former
kings, and demanded tribute from it as from other places.
Thorfinn, however, did not think his inheritance from his
mother’s father large, though he had Caithness; and besides,
according to his own opinion, it had been given to him first;
he was therefore unwilling to pay any tribute. Thus they
became open enemies, and made war on each other. King
Karl wished to appoint a chief, by name Moddan, over
Caithness; he was his sister’s son, and he gave him the
title of Earl. Then Moddan went down from Scotland and
collected forces in Sutherland.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>When Earl Thorfinn heard of this, he gathered together an
army in Caithness. Thorkel Fóstri also came to Earl Thorfinn
from the Orkneys with many men, and their united forces
were somewhat more numerous than those of the Scots.
When the Scots knew this they hesitated in their invasion,
and returned to Scotland. Earl Thorfinn subdued Sutherland
and Ross, and plundered far and wide in Scotland, and
returned again to Caithness, and Thorkel went back to the
Islands; their men also returned home. Earl Thorfinn
stayed at Dungalsbæ, in Caithness, where he had five war-ships
and followers numerous enough to man them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Moddan came to find King Karl (at Beruvik)<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c017'><sup>[253]</sup></a> and
informed him of his unsuccessful expedition. The King
became very angry at his land being plundered, and started
immediately with eleven war-ships and a numerous army.
He sailed northward along Scotland, after having despatched
Moddan to Caithness a second time with many troops.
Moddan went by land, and it was intended that he should
make the attack from that side, so that Earl Thorfinn might
be placed between the two armies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, it is to be told of King Karl that he did not stop
until he arrived at Caithness, and he and Earl Thorfinn
were not far from each other. Thorfinn went on board his
ships, and sailed out on the Pentland Firth, intending to
go to the Orkneys; and so near were they that King Karl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>saw their sails as he sailed into the Firth from the east, and
immediately sailed after them. Earl Thorfinn directed his
course to the east of the Orkneys, intending to go to Sandvik.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c017'><sup>[254]</sup></a>
He moored his ships on the east side of Dyrness, and
immediately sent word to Thorkel to collect troops.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Thorfinn arrived at Dyrness late in the evening;
but as soon as it was daylight next morning, King Karl
came upon them unawares with eleven war-ships. There
were only two alternatives—one to run on shore, and leave
the ships with all their valuable contents to the enemy; the
other was to meet the King, and let fate decide between
them. Earl Thorfinn exhorted his men, and ordered them
to have their arms ready. He said he would not flee, and
told them to row briskly towards the enemy. Then both
parties fastened their ships together. Earl Thorfinn addressed
his men, advising them to be smart and to make
the first attack fiercely, and saying that few of the Scotsmen
would be able to make a stand. The fighting was long and
fierce. Arnór Jarlaskáld says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Once, off Dyrness, to the eastward,</div>
      <div class='line'>Came King Kali in a mail-coat</div>
      <div class='line'>Famous for its strength and brightness;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the land was not defenceless,</div>
      <div class='line'>For, with five ships, nothing daunted,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scorning flight in warlike temper,</div>
      <div class='line'>Valiantly the Prince went forward</div>
      <div class='line'>’Gainst the King’s eleven vessels.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then the ships were lashed together—</div>
      <div class='line'>Know ye how the men were falling?</div>
      <div class='line'>All their swords and boards were swimming</div>
      <div class='line'>In the life-blood of the Scotsmen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hearts were sinking—bowstrings screaming,</div>
      <div class='line'>Darts were flying—spear-shafts bending;</div>
      <div class='line'>Swords were biting, blood flowed freely,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the Prince’s heart was merry.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Now Earl Thorfinn incited his men to the utmost, and
a fierce conflict ensued.  The Scots in the King’s ships
made but a feeble resistance before the mast, whereupon
Thorfinn jumped from the quarter-deck, and ran to the foredeck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and fought fiercely. When he saw the crowd in the
King’s ships getting thinner, he urged his men to board
them. King Karl, perceiving this, gave orders to his men
to cut the ropes, and get the ships away instantly; to take
to their oars, and bear away. At the same time Thorfinn
and his men fastened grappling-hooks in the King’s ship.
He called for his banner to be borne before him, and a great
number of his men followed it. King Karl jumped from
his ship into another vessel, with those of his men who
still held out; but the most part had fallen already. He
then ordered them to take to their oars; and the Scots took
to flight—Thorfinn pursuing them. Thus says Arnór:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Never was a battle shorter;</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon with spears it was decided.</div>
      <div class='line'>Though my lord had fewer numbers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet he chased them all before him;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hoarsely croaked the battle-gull, when</div>
      <div class='line'>Thickly fell the wounded king’s-men;</div>
      <div class='line'>South of Sandwick swords were reddened.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>King Karl fled all the way south to Breidafiord,<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c017'><sup>[255]</sup></a> where
he went on shore, and collected an army anew. Earl Thorfinn
went back after the battle, when Thorkel Fóstri came
to him with a numerous army. They then sailed south to
Breidafiord in pursuit of King Karl, and when they came to
Scotland they began to plunder. Then they were told that
Earl Moddan was at Thurso, in Caithness, with a large
army. He had sent to Ireland for men, because he had
there many relatives and friends, and he was waiting for
these troops. Then it was thought advisable that Thorkel
should go to Caithness with a portion of the army; but
Thorfinn remained in Scotland, and plundered there.
Thorkel went secretly, because all the inhabitants of Caithness
were true and faithful to him; and no news went of
his journey till he came to Thurso by night, and surprised
Earl Moddan in a house, which they set on fire. Moddan
was asleep in an upper storey, and jumped out; but as he
jumped down from the stair, Thorkel hewed at him with a
sword, and it hit him on the neck, and took off his head.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>After this his men surrendered, but some escaped by flight.
Many were slain, but some received quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorkel did not stay there long, but went to Breidafiord,
bringing with him all the men he had been able to collect
in Caithness, Sutherland, and Ross. He met Earl Thorfinn
in Moray, and told him what he had done in his expedition,
for which he received hearty thanks from the Earl,
and there they both stayed for a while.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE ORKNEYMEN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> it is to be told of King Karl that he went to Scotland
after the battle with Earl Thorfinn, and collected an army as
well from the south as the west and east of Scotland, and all
the way south from Satiri (Kintyre); the forces for which
Earl Moddan had sent also came to him from Ireland. He
sent far and near to the chieftains for men, and brought all
this army against Earl Thorfinn. They met at Torfnes,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c017'><sup>[256]</sup></a> on
the south side of Bæfiord. There was a fierce battle, and
the Scots were by far the most numerous. Earl Thorfinn
was among the foremost of his men; he had a gold-plated
helmet on his head, a sword at his belt, and a spear in his
hand, and he cut and thrust with both hands. It is even
said that he was foremost of all his men. He first attacked
the Irish division, and so fierce were he and his men, that
the Irish were immediately routed, and never regained their
position. Then King Karl had his standard brought forward
against Earl Thorfinn, and there was the fiercest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>struggle for a while; but it ended in the flight of the King;
and some say he was slain. Thus Arnór Jarlaskáld:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Reddened were the wolf’s-bit’s edges</div>
      <div class='line'>At a place—men call it Torfness;—</div>
      <div class='line'>It was by a youthful ruler</div>
      <div class='line'>This was done, upon a Monday.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pliant swords were loudly ringing</div>
      <div class='line'>At this War-Thing, south of Ekkial,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the prince had joined in battle</div>
      <div class='line'>Bravely with the King of Scotland.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>High his helm the Lord of Hjaltland</div>
      <div class='line'>Bore amid the clang of weapons;</div>
      <div class='line'>In the battle ever foremost,</div>
      <div class='line'>Reddened he his gleaming spear-point</div>
      <div class='line'>In the wounds it gave the Irish.</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus my lord his mighty prowess</div>
      <div class='line'>Showed beneath his British buckler—</div>
      <div class='line'>Taking many warriors captive;</div>
      <div class='line'>Hlödver’s kinsman burnt the country.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Earl Thorfinn drove the fugitives before him through Scotland,
and subdued the country wherever he went, and all the
way south to Fife. Then he sent Thorkel Fóstri away with
some of his men. When the Scots heard that the Earl had
sent away some of his men, those that had submitted to him
meant to attack him. As soon, however, as he was aware of
their treachery, he called his men together and went to meet
them; but when they knew he was prepared, they hesitated
to make the attack. Earl Thorfinn resolved to give battle
to the Scots as soon as he met them; but they had not the
manliness to defend themselves, and ran away into woods
and deserted places; and when he had pursued the fugitives,
he called his men together, and said he would burn the
whole district, and thus pay the Scots for their treachery.
Then the Earl’s men went over hamlets and farms, and
burnt everything, so that scarcely a hut was left standing.
Those of the men whom they found they killed, but the
women and old people dragged themselves into woods and
deserted places, with wailings and lamentations. Some of
them they drove before them, and many were taken captives.
Thus says Arnór Jarlaskáld:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Fast the flames devoured the homesteads;</div>
      <div class='line'>Lives that day were in great peril;</div>
      <div class='line'>Fire the Scottish kingdom ravaged—</div>

      <div class='line'>Great the mischief done that summer</div>
      <div class='line'>By the mighty Slaughter-Teacher;</div>
      <div class='line'>Three times were the luckless Scotsmen</div>
      <div class='line'>By the Prince completely vanquished.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>After this Thorfinn went through Scotland to the
north, till he reached his ships, and subdued the country
wherever he went, and did not stop till he came to Caithness,
where he spent the winter; but every season after
this he went out on expeditions, and plundered in the
summer time with all his men.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE FAMOUS DEEDS OF EARL THORFINN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Thorfinn</span> made himself famous in the Orkneys by
entertaining his own men and many other men of note
throughout the winter, so that no one had to go to inns—providing
food and drink at his own charges, in the same
manner as chiefs in other countries, Kings, and Earls entertain
their henchmen and guests at Christmas time. About
this time Earl Brúsi died, and Earl Thorfinn took possession
of all the islands. But of Rögnvald, Brúsi’s son, it is said
that he was in the battle of Stiklestad<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c017'><sup>[257]</sup></a> when King Olaf was
killed. Rögnvald escaped, with other fugitives, and carried
away King Olaf’s brother, Harald Sigurdson, who was dangerously
wounded, and brought him to a small Bondi to be cured;
but he himself crossed the Kjöl,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c017'><sup>[258]</sup></a> and went to Jamtaland,
and thence to Sweden to see King Onund. Harald stayed
with the Bondi until he had recovered from his wounds.
The Bondi then gave him his son as an attendant, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>went through Jamtaland to Sweden secretly.  At their
parting, which took place in a certain copse, Harald sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Though now thus here and there I’m hunted</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the covert—small’s the honour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who knows but that far and wide yet</div>
      <div class='line'>Some day shall my name be famous?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Harald met Rögnvald in Sweden, and they went both
of them east to Gardariki (Russia), along with many others
who had been with King Olaf. They did not stop till they
came east to King Jarizleif, in Hólmgard;<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c017'><sup>[259]</sup></a> and he received
them most heartily for the sake of King Olaf the
Holy. He took them both, as well as Erling, Rögnvald’s
son, into his service as defenders of his country.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MAGNUS, OLAF’S SON, ACCEPTED KING OF NORWAY.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rögnvald</span>, Brúsi’s son, remained in Gardariki (Russia) when
Harald, Sigurd’s son, went to Mikligard (Constantinople); he
had the defence of the frontier in summer, and spent the
winters in Hólmgard. The King as well as the people
esteemed him highly. Rögnvald was a man of large stature
and great strength, and one of the handsomest men in appearance,
and his accomplishments were such that his equal
was hardly to be found. Arnór Jarlaskáld says that he
fought ten battles in Gardar:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So it happened that ten battles</div>
      <div class='line'>Fought the soldier fierce in Gardar.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Einar Thambarskelfir and Kálf Arnason brought Magnus,
Olaf’s son, from Gardariki (Russia). Rögnvald met them in
Aldeigiuborg.<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c017'><sup>[260]</sup></a> He had nearly made an attack on Kálf before
he had informed him of their business. Einar said that
Kálf repented of (his share in) the great crime of having
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>deprived King Olaf the Holy of his life and kingdom, and
that he now wished to make amends to his son Magnus.
He further told Rögnvald that Kálf wished to place Magnus
on the throne, and support him against the Vikings in the
pay of the Canutes. By this Rögnvald was softened, and
now Einar Thambarskelfir asked him to go with them up to
Hólmgard, and introduce them and their business to King
Jarizleif. He should tell him that the Norwegians were so
disgusted with the rule of the Canutes, but most of all with
Alfifa,<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c017'><sup>[261]</sup></a> that they would prefer any hardships to serving them
longer; and then he should ask King Jarizleif to permit
Magnus, Olaf’s son, to become their chief. When they came
there, Rögnvald, Queen Ingigerd,<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c017'><sup>[262]</sup></a> and many of the noblemen,
pleaded their cause. King Jarizleif was unwilling to trust
Magnus into the hands of the Norwegians, because of their
treatment of his father. At last, however, they succeeded
so far that twelve of the noblest men made oaths to the effect
that their offers were sincere; but King Jarizleif trusted
Rögnvald so much that he did not require him to swear.
Kálf promised King Magnus with an oath that he would
accompany him both within his kingdom and out of it, and
do everything to support his power and to secure his safety.
Thereupon the Norwegians accepted Magnus as their King,
and swore fealty to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Einar and Kálf stayed in Hólmgard till after Christmas.
Then they went down to Aldeigiuborg (Ladoga), and procured
ships. As soon as the sea was open in the spring, Rögnvald,
Brúsi’s son, made himself ready to go with King Magnus.
They went first to Sweden, then to Jamtaland, crossed the
Kjöl, and came to Veradal. When King Magnus came to
Thrándheim, all the population submitted to him. Then he
went down to Nídarós,<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c017'><sup>[263]</sup></a> and was accepted King of the whole
country at the Eyrar-Thing. After this came the dealings
of King Magnus and King Sveinn.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>RÖGNVALD ASKS MAGNUS FOR LEAVE TO GO TO THE ISLANDS.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Rögnvald, Brúsi’s son, came to Norway, he heard of
the death of his father Brúsi, and at the same time, that Earl
Thorfinn had taken possession of the whole of the Islands.
Then he wished to visit his odal possessions, and asked King
Magnus to permit him to go. The King saw that it was
necessary for him to go, and willingly gave him permission.
At the same time, he gave him the title of Earl, and three
war-ships well equipped. He also gave him a grant of that
third part of the Orkneys which King Olaf had possessed,<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c017'><sup>[264]</sup></a>
and had given to his father Brúsi. At last King Magnus
promised his foster-brother his full friendship, adding that
his assistance should be at his service whenever he required
it. Thus they parted the best of friends.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF ROGNVALD’S VOYAGE.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Rögnvald</span> sailed for the Orkneys, and went first to the
estates which his father had possessed. Thence he sent
messengers to his kinsman, Earl Thorfinn, and asked for that
third part (of the Islands) which had belonged to his father.
He also requested them to tell him that he had obtained
from King Magnus a grant of that third which had belonged
to King Olaf. He therefore demanded two-thirds, if it was
the pleasure of his kinsman Thorfinn. At this time Thorfinn
had great quarrels with the Irish and the inhabitants of
the Sudreyar (Hebrides), and felt himself greatly in want of
assistance. He therefore gave Rögnvald’s messengers the
following reply:—That Rögnvald should take possession of
that third which rightly belonged to him. “As for the
third which Magnus calls his own,” he said, “we gave that
up to King Olaf the Holy because we were then in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>power, but not because we thought it just. I and my kinsman
Rögnvald will agree all the better the less we talk of
that third, which has been long enough a cause of dispute.
But if Rögnvald wishes to be my faithful friend, I consider
those possessions in good hands which he has for his pleasure
and for the good of us both. His assistance will soon be of
greater value to me than the revenues which I derive from
them.”</p>
<p class='c008'>Upon this the messengers returned, and said he had
yielded up to Rögnvald two-thirds on condition that they
should be allies, as it was right they should be, on account
of their relationship. Rögnvald said, however, that he did
not demand more than what he considered his own; but as
Thorfinn had so willingly given up the lands, he would indeed
assist him, and be his firm friend, which was but natural, as
they were so nearly related. Accordingly Rögnvald took
possession of two-thirds of the islands.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE BATTLE OF THE KINSMEN THORFINN AND ROGNVALD.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Early</span> in the spring Thorfinn sent word to his kinsman
Rögnvald, and asked him to go out with him on an expedition,
bringing as many men as he could. As soon as
Rögnvald received this message, he collected together as
many men and vessels as he could, and when he was ready
he went to meet Earl Thorfinn, who was also ready with his
band. He received his kinsman Rögnvald very well; and
they joined their forces. During the summer they plundered
in the Sudreyar (Hebrides), and in Ireland, and in
Scotland’s Fiord;<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c017'><sup>[265]</sup></a> and Thorfinn conquered the land wherever
he went. They had a great battle at a place called Vatnsfiord.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c017'><sup>[266]</sup></a>
It began early in the morning, and the kinsmen
gained the victory. This is mentioned by Arnór Jarlaskáld:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Know ye that place, Vatnsfiord?</div>

      <div class='line'>Of the gray wolf o’er the corpses.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>After this battle they returned to the Orkneys, and
stayed at home during the winter. Thus eight winters
passed that Earl Rögnvald had two-thirds of the islands
without any objection on the part of Earl Thorfinn. Every
summer they went out on war expeditions, sometimes both
together, sometimes separately, as Arnór says:</p>

      <div class='line'>Fire devoured the Scottish kingdom.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The kinsmen agreed very well whenever they met; but
when bad men went between them dissensions often arose.
Earl Thorfinn dwelt for the most part in Caithness, at the
place called Gaddgedlar,<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c017'><sup>[267]</sup></a> where Scotland and England (?)
meet.</p>

</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>One</span> summer Earl Thorfinn made war in the Sudreyar
(Hebrides) and in Scotland. He had sent men into England
to foray, and they carried away all the spoil they could find.
But when the English became aware of the presence of the
Vikings, they gathered together and attacked them. They
took from them all the cattle, and killed all the men that
were of any note, but sent back some of the reivers, and
requested them to tell Earl Thorfinn how they had made the
Vikings tired of plunder and rapine, to which they added
many insulting words. Thereupon the reivers went to Earl
Thorfinn and told him of their mishaps. He was greatly
annoyed at the loss of his men, yet he said he could not then
do anything, and that they would have to refrain at this
time; but he said he was quite able to repay the Englishmen
for their mockery, and would do so if he were well next
summer.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL THORFINN’S EXPEDITION TO ENGLAND.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>At</span> that time Hardicanute was King of England and Denmark.
Earl Thorfinn went to the Orkneys and spent the
winter there. Early in the spring he called out a levy from
all his domains, and sent word to his kinsman Rögnvald.
Rögnvald assented, and called out men from all his possessions.
Earl Thorfinn collected troops in Caithness and the
Orkneys. He also had many from Scotland and Ireland, and
from the Sudreyar (Hebrides), and with all these forces he
sailed to England as he had promised. Hardicanute was in
Denmark at the time. As soon as the Earls came into
England they began to harry and plunder; but the chiefs
whose duty it was to defend the land went to meet them
with an army. There was a great and fierce battle, in which
the Earls gained the victory. After this they plundered far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>and wide in England, slaying men, and burning the dwellings
of the people. This is mentioned by Arnór:</p>

<p class='c021'>Earl Thorfinn had two pitched battles in England.
Besides, he had many casual encounters, and slew many
people. He stayed there throughout the summer, and went
back in autumn to the Orkneys for the winter.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>KALF FLEES TO THE ORKNEYS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>About</span> this time Kálf Arnason was banished by King Magnus.
He crossed the seas, and went to Earl Thorfinn, his
brother-in-law. Thorfinn’s wife was then Ingibiorg, the
mother of the Earls (Paul and Erlend), and daughter of Earl
Finn Arnason. There was great friendship between Kálf
and Earl Thorfinn. The Earl had a great many of his men
about him, which became very expensive to him. Then there
were many who advised him not to leave two-thirds of the
Islands to Rögnvald, since his own expenses were so large.
Thereupon Earl Thorfinn sent men into the Islands to demand
from Rögnvald that third portion which had belonged to Earl
Einar Rangmuth (wry-mouth).</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Upon receiving this message, the Earl (Rögnvald) consulted
with his friends. Then he called Earl Thorfinn’s
messengers, and told them that he had received that portion
of the Islands which they claimed as a fief from King Magnus,
and that the King called it his patrimony. “It was
therefore,” he said, “in the power of King Magnus to decide
which of them should have it; and he would not give it up
if the King wished him to retain it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The messengers went away, and told these words to Earl
Thorfinn, adding that the third portion [which he had demanded]
would certainly not be got without trouble. On
hearing this, Earl Thorfinn became very angry, and said that
it was unfair if King Magnus should have the inheritance of
his brother, adding that he had yielded to the demand more
because he was then in King Olaf’s power than because it
was a just claim. “Now,” he said, “I think Rögnvald does
not return me well my good will in having left him in quiet
possession for a time, if I am not to have the inheritance of
my brother now except by fighting for it.” Now Earl Thorfinn
became so enraged that he straightway sent men to the
Hebrides and to Scotland, and collected together an army,
making it known that he would march against Rögnvald,
and demand that without abatement which he had not got
when he asked peacefully for it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this was told to Earl Rögnvald, he called his
friends together, and complained to them of his kinsman
Thorfinn intending to come and make war on him. He
then asked what help they would offer him, saying that he
would not give up his own without a trial of strength.
But when he asked them to declare themselves, their
opinions were very different. Some spoke in favour of
Earl Rögnvald, and said that one could not be hard upon
him for not being willing to part with his possessions;
others again said it was excusable on the part of Earl Thorfinn
to desire to have those possessions for a while which
Rögnvald had had before, and which had belonged to Earl
Einar. Further, they said it was the greatest foolishness for
Rögnvald to fight with such troops as he could get from two-thirds
of the Islands against Thorfinn, who had one-third,
with Caithness, a great deal of Scotland, and all the Hebrides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>besides. There were also those who advised reconciliation.
They asked Earl Rögnvald to offer Earl Thorfinn one-half of
the Islands, so that they might still be friends, as it was meet
they should be, owing to their relationship. But when
Rögnvald found that their opinions were divided, and that
they all dissuaded him from resistance, he made known his
determination that he would not part with his possessions
by any arrangement, but that he would rather leave them for
a time, and go to King Magnus, his foster-brother, and see
what assistance he would give him to retain them. Then
he made ready, and went to Norway, and did not rest until
he came to King Magnus, and told him how matters stood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The King received Earl Rögnvald very well, and invited
him to stay as long as he liked, and to receive such lands
from him as were sufficient to keep him and his men; but
Earl Rögnvald said he wished assistance to recover his possessions.
King Magnus said he would certainly give him
such aid as he stood in need of. Rögnvald stayed a short
time in Norway, until he had made ready his expedition for
the Orkneys. He had a numerous and well-equipped army,
which King Magnus had given him. The King also sent
word to Kálf Arnason that he should have his estates restored
to him, and be permitted to stay in Norway, if he took
Earl Rögnvald’s part in his dispute with Earl Thorfinn.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>BATTLE OF RAUDABIORG.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Rögnvald</span> sailed from Norway for the Orkneys, and
landed in Hjaltland (Shetland), where he collected men, and
went thence to the Orkneys. There he summoned his
friends to meet him, and obtained reinforcements. Earl
Thorfinn was in Caithness, and news soon reached him
of Earl Rögnvald’s proceedings. He collected forces from
Scotland and the Sudreyar (Hebrides). Rögnvald immediately
sent King Magnus’s message to Kálf Arnason, who
apparently received very well all that the King had said.
Earl Rögnvald collected his army together in the Orkneys,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>intending to cross over to Caithness, and when he sailed into
the Pentland Firth he had thirty large ships. There he was
met by Earl Thorfinn, who had sixty ships, but most of them
small. They met off Raudabiorg<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c017'><sup>[268]</sup></a> (red cliff), and at once
prepared for battle.</p>
<p class='c008'>Kálf Arnason was there also; he had six ships, all of
them large, but did not take part in the fight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now the battle began with the utmost fury, both Earls
encouraging their men. When the fighting had thus continued
for a while, the loss of men began to be heaviest on
Earl Thorfinn’s side, the chief cause being the great difference
in the height of the ships. Thorfinn himself had a large
ship, well equipped, in which he pressed forward with great
daring; but when the smaller vessels were cleared, the Earl’s
ship was attacked from both sides, and they were placed in
great danger. Many of the Earl’s men were killed, and
others dangerously wounded. Then Earl Rögnvald commanded
his men to leap on board; but when Thorfinn perceived
the imminent danger, he caused the ropes to be cut
with which his ship was fastened to the other, and rowed
towards the shore. He had seventy dead bodies removed
from his ship, and all those who were disabled by wounds
went also on shore. Then Thorfinn ordered Arnór Jarlaskáld,
who was among the Earl’s men and high in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>favour, to go on shore; and on landing he sang these
verses:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This will I not hide from comrades,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though ’tis right one’s chief to follow,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet am I myself unwilling</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus to meet the son of Brúsi.</div>
      <div class='line'>When these Earls so fierce in battle</div>
      <div class='line'>Close in fight, then will our case be</div>
      <div class='line'>Hard beyond the case of most men</div>
      <div class='line'>In this trial of our friendship.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Earl Thorfinn selected the ablest of his men to man his
ship, and then he went to see Kálf Arnason, and asked his
assistance. He said that Kálf would not be able to buy
king Magnus’s friendship, since he had already been banished,
and was therefore unable to keep the king’s favour, even when
they were once reconciled. “You may be sure,” he added,
“that if Rögnvald overcomes me, and he and King Magnus
become masters here in the west, you will not be welcome
in this quarter, but if I come off victorious you shall lack
nothing that it is in my power to give you. If we two keep
together we shall be a match for any one here in the west,
and I hardly think you will allow yourself to lie crouching
aside like a cat among stones while I am fighting for behoof
of us both. Moreover our ties are so close that it is more
seemly for us to aid each other, since you have no ties of
blood or affinity with our enemies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Kálf heard Thorfinn’s persuasions he called his
men and gave orders to fall to and fight on the side of Earl
Thorfinn. Now Thorfinn and Kálf both rowed back to the
fight, and when they arrived Thorfinn’s men were ready to
fly, and many of them had been slain. The Earl pushed his
ship forward against that of Earl Rögnvald, and a fierce fight
ensued. As is said by Arnór Jarlaskáld—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then I saw the two wealth-givers</div>
      <div class='line'>Hewing down each other’s warriors.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fierce the fight was in the Pentland,</div>
      <div class='line'>As the sea swelled and the red rain</div>
      <div class='line'>Crimsoned all the yielding timbers,</div>
      <div class='line'>While from shield-rims sweat of hot blood</div>
      <div class='line'>Dripping, stained the warriors’ garments.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>Kálf attacked Rögnvald’s smaller ships, and speedily
cleared them, as there was a great difference in the height of
the ships. When the hired troops from Norway saw the
vessels beside them cleared they cut away their ship and fled.
Then only a few ships remained with Earl Rögnvald, and the
victory began to lean the other way. So says Arnór Jarlaskáld:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Then the prince so fierce in battle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Valiant kinsman of the Vikings,</div>
      <div class='line'>All the old land might have conquered</div>
      <div class='line'>With assistance of the Islesmen.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fewer were his slaughtered heroes;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the chief’s strong men in helmets,</div>
      <div class='line'>All the way to northern Hjaltland,</div>
      <div class='line'>Chased the weak and flying remnant.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And when the main portion of the troops had fled, Kálf
and Earl Thorfinn attacked Earl Rögnvald’s ship together,
and then a great number of his men were slain. When he
saw the imminent danger, and that he would not be able to
overcome Thorfinn and Kálf, he had the cables cut, and fled.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was now late in the day, and darkness was coming
on. Earl Rögnvald stood out to sea the same night, and
sailed for Norway, and did not stop till he found King
Magnus, who received him well, as he had done before, and
invited him to remain with him, and there he stayed some
time.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL THORFINN SUBDUES THE ISLANDS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> it is to be told of Earl Thorfinn that on the morning
after the battle he sent boats to all the islands to search for
the fugitives. Many were killed, and some were pardoned.
Earl Thorfinn subdued all the Islands, and made all the inhabitants
his subjects, even those who had sworn allegiance
to Earl Rögnvald. Thorfinn then fixed his residence in the
Orkneys, keeping a great number of men about him; he imported
provisions from Caithness, and sent Kálf Arnason to
the Sudreyar (Hebrides), and ordered him to remain and
maintain his authority there.</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>When Earl Rögnvald had stayed with King Magnus for
some time, he said to the King that he wished to go back to
the Islands. When the King heard this he said it was not
wise, and advised him to remain until the winter had passed
away and the sea was free from ice. Yet he said that he
would give him as many men as he wanted, and a sufficient
number of ships. Rögnvald in reply said that this time he
would go without the King’s men, adding that he could not
lead an army against Earl Thorfinn without a great loss of
men, as he had such extensive dominions in the west.
“This time,” he continued, “I intend to go to the west in a
single ship, as well manned as possible; thus I expect there
will be no news of us beforehand; and if I get to the Islands
I shall take them by surprise, and then we may speedily
gain such a victory as could hardly, if at all, be gained by a
number of troops; but if they become aware of our movements
we can still let the sea take care of us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>King Magnus said he might go as he pleased, and
return to him when he wished.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this Rögnvald made his ship ready, and selected
the crew carefully. Several of King Magnus’s henchmen
went with him, and altogether he had a picked crew in his
vessel. When they were ready they sailed out to sea and
had a fair wind. This was early in the winter.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>RÖGNVALD COMES TO THE ISLANDS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rögnvald</span> first came off the coast of Hjaltland (Shetland),
and heard that Earl Thorfinn was in the Orkneys with few
men, because he did not expect any enemies in the depth of
winter. Rögnvald went straightway to the Orkneys. Earl
Thorfinn was in Hrossey,<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c017'><sup>[269]</sup></a> suspecting nothing. When
Rögnvald arrived in the Orkneys, he went where he had heard
that Earl Thorfinn was, and came upon him unawares, so
that his presence was not known until he had secured
all the doors of the house in which the Earl and his men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>were. It was in the night time, and most of the men were
asleep, but the Earl was still sitting over his drink. Rögnvald
and his men set fire to the house. When Earl Thorfinn
became aware of the presence of enemies he sent men to the
door to know who they were. They were told that it was
Earl Rögnvald. Then they all leaped to their weapons, but
they were unable to do anything in the way of defence, as
they were all prevented from getting out. The house was
soon in flames, and Earl Thorfinn said that permission should
be asked for those to go out who were to receive quarter.
When this was asked of Earl Rögnvald he permitted all the
women and thralls to go out, but he said that most of
Thorfinn’s henchmen would be no better to him alive than
dead. Those who were spared were dragged out, and the
house began to burn down. Earl Thorfinn bethought him
of a plan, and broke down part of the woodwork of the
house and leaped out there, carrying Ingibiorg, his wife, in
his arms. As the night was pitch dark he got away in the
smoke unperceived by Earl Rögnvald’s men, and during the
night he rowed alone in a boat over to Ness (Caithness).
Earl Rögnvald burnt the house, with all who were in it, and no
one thought otherwise than that Earl Thorfinn had perished
there.</p>
<p class='c008'>After this Rögnvald went over the Islands and took
possession of them all. He also sent messages over to Ness
(Caithness), and to the Sudreyar (Hebrides), to the effect
that he intended to have all the dominions of Thorfinn, and
nobody spoke against him. Earl Thorfinn was then in
Caithness in hiding with his friends, and no news went
abroad of his escape from the burning.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL RÖGNVALD SLAIN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Rögnvald</span> resided in Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall), and
brought there all necessaries for the winter; he had a great
number of men, and entertained them liberally. A little
before Christmas the Earl went with a numerous following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>into little Papey<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c017'><sup>[270]</sup></a> to fetch malt for the Christmas brewing.
The evening which they stayed in the islands they sat a
long time round the fires to warm themselves, and he who
had to keep up the fires said they were running short of
fuel. Then the Earl made a slip of the tongue in speaking,
and said: “We shall be old enough when these fires are
burnt out,” but he intended to have said that they would be
warm enough; and when he noticed his blunder he said:
“I made a slip of the tongue in speaking just now; I do
not remember that I ever did so before, and now I recollect
what my foster-father King Olaf said at Stiklestad when
I noticed a slip of the tongue which he made—namely, that
if it ever so happened that I should make a slip in my
speech I should not expect to live long after it. It may be
that my kinsman Thorfinn is still alive.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At that moment they heard that the house was surrounded
by men. It was Earl Thorfinn and his men. They set the
house on fire immediately, and heaped up a large pile before
the door. Thorfinn permitted all others to come out except
Earl Rögnvald’s men, and when most of them had gone out
a man came to the door dressed in linen clothes only, and
asked Earl Thorfinn to lend a hand to the deacon; this man
placed his hands on the wall and sprang over it and over
the ring of men, and came down a great way off, and disappeared
immediately in the darkness of the night. Earl
Thorfinn told his men to go after him, saying: “There went
the Earl, for that is his feat and no other man’s.” They
went away, and divided into parties to search for him.
Thorkel Fóstri with some others went along the beach, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>they heard the barking of a dog among the rocks by the
sea. Earl Rögnvald had had his favourite dog with him.
Thorkel had the Earl seized, and asked his men to kill him,
offering them a reward in money. But no one would do it.
So Thorkel Fóstri slew Earl Rögnvald himself, as he knew
that one of the two (Earls) must die. Then Earl Thorfinn
came up, and did not find fault with the deed. They spent
the night in the island, and all were killed who had accompanied
Earl Rögnvald thither.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next morning they took a barge and filled it with malt;
then they went on board and ranged the shields which had
belonged to Earl Rögnvald and his men along the bulwarks,
neither had they more men in the barge than Rögnvald had
had. So they rowed to Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall); and when
those of Rögnvald’s men who were there saw the vessel they
thought it was Earl Rögnvald and his men returning, and
they went unarmed to meet them. Thorfinn seized thirty
of them and slew them; most of them were henchmen and
friends of King Magnus. To one of the King’s henchmen
the Earl gave quarter, and told him to go east to Norway
and tell King Magnus the tidings.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL RÖGNVALD’S BURIAL.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> body of Earl Rögnvald was brought to the larger Papey<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c017'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
and buried there. Men said that he was one of the most
accomplished and best-beloved of all the Earls of the Orkneys;
and his death was greatly lamented by all the people.</p>
<p class='c008'>After this Earl Thorfinn took possession of the whole of
the Islands, and no one spoke against him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early in the spring these tidings came east to Norway
to King Magnus. He regarded the death of Rögnvald, his
foster-brother, as a great loss, and said he would avenge him
by and by, but just then he was at war with King Swein,
Ulf’s son.<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c017'><sup>[272]</sup></a></p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL THORFINN COMES TO KING HARALD.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>About</span> this time King Harald, Sigurd’s son,<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c017'><sup>[273]</sup></a> King Magnus’s
uncle, arrived in Norway, and King Magnus gave him the
half of the kingdom. One winter they called out men from
the whole of Norway, intending to go south to Denmark,
but while they lay in Seley<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c017'><sup>[274]</sup></a> two war ships rowed into
the harbour and up to King Magnus’s ship. A man in a
white cloak went from the [strange] ship, and along the
[King’s] ship, and up to the quarterdeck. The King sat at
meat; the man saluted him, and taking up a loaf he broke
it and ate of it. The King received his salutation, and
handed the cup to him when he saw that he ate the bread.
The King looked at him and said: “Who is this man?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My name is Thorfinn,” he said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Art thou Earl Thorfinn?” said the King.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So am I called in the west,” he said, “and I am here
with two ships of twenty benches, well manned considering
our means, and I wish now to join in this expedition with
you, if you will accept my assistance; all my men and I
myself are in God’s power and yours, my lord, on account of
my great misdeeds by which I have offended you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the meantime some men gathered together and
listened to their conversation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is true, Earl Thorfinn” (said the King), “that I
intended, in case we should meet, that you should not have
to tell of our parting, but now matters stand so that it does
not become my dignity to have you slain, and you shall go
with me now, but the terms of our reconciliation I will
declare when I am more at leisure.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Thorfinn thanked the King and returned to his
ship. The King stayed a long time in Seley, and men
gathered to him from Vík;<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c017'><sup>[275]</sup></a> for he intended to sail to Jutland
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>when he obtained a fair wind. Thorfinn was often in
conversation with the King, who treated him in a friendly
manner, and had him frequently present at his councils.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day the Earl went on board the King’s ship, and
went up to the poop. The King asked him to sit down.
The Earl sat down, and they both drank together and were
merry. A tall brave-looking man, dressed in a red
tunic, came to the poop and saluted the King, who received
his greeting graciously. He was one of the King’s henchmen.
He said: “I have come to see you, Earl Thorfinn.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“What is your business with me?” said the Earl.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wish to know what compensation you intend to give
me for my brother who was killed by your orders out west
in Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall), along with others of King
Magnus’s henchmen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Have you never heard,” said the Earl, “that it is not
my wont to pay money for the men whom I cause to be
killed?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have nothing to do with how you have treated other
people, if you pay the manbote for him for whom it devolves
on me to seek compensation. I also lost some money there
myself, and was shamefully treated. It is more binding on
me than any one else to seek redress for my brother and
myself, and therefore I now demand it. The King may
remit offences committed against himself, even if he thinks
it of no importance that his henchmen are led out and
slaughtered like sheep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl answered: “I understand it to be to my advantage
here that I am not in your power. Are not you
the man to whom I gave quarter there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“True enough,” said he, “it was in your power to have
killed me like the others.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the Earl said: “Now the saying proves true—‘That
often happens to many which they least expect.’ I never
thought I should be so placed that it would be injurious
to me to have been too generous to my enemies; but now
I have to pay for having given you quarter; you would
not have denounced me to-day in the presence of chiefs if I
had caused you to be killed like your comrades.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The King looked at the Earl and said: “There it comes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>out still, Earl Thorfinn, that you think you have killed too
few of my henchmen without compensation.” While saying
this the king turned blood-red [with anger]. The Earl
started up and left the poop, and returned to his own ship,
and all was quiet during the evening. In the morning,
when the men awoke, a fair wind had sprung up, and they
rowed away from the harbour. The King sailed south to
Jutland with the whole fleet. In the earlier part of the day
the Earl’s ship stood out farther to sea, and in the afternoon
he took a westerly course, and there is nothing to be told of
him till he arrived in the Orkneys, and resumed the government
of his dominions.</p>

<p class='c008'>King Magnus and Harald sailed to Denmark, and spent
the summer there. King Swein was unwilling to meet
them, and stayed in Skàney<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c017'><sup>[276]</sup></a> with his army. That summer
King Magnus was seized with an illness of which he died;
but he had previously declared that he gave the whole kingdom
of Norway to his uncle Harald.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL THORFINN’S MESSAGE TO KING HARALD (HARDRADI).</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Thorfinn</span> now ruled the Orkneys and all his dominions.
Kálf Arnason was frequently with him. Sometimes he
made viking expeditions to the west, and plundered in
Scotland and Ireland. He was also in England, and at one
time he was the chief of the Thingmen.</p>
<p class='c008'>When Earl Thorfinn heard of the death of King Magnus, he
sent men to Norway to King Harald with a friendly message,
saying that he wished to become his friend. When the
messengers reached the King he received them well, and promised
the Earl his friendship. When the Earl received this
message from the King he made himself ready, taking from the
west two ships of twenty benches, with more than a hundred
men, all fine troops, and went east to Norway. He found the
King in Hördaland, and he received him exceedingly well,
and at their parting the King gave him handsome presents.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>From thence the Earl went southwards along the coast to
Denmark. He went through the country, and found King
Svein in Alaborg;<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c017'><sup>[277]</sup></a> he invited him to stay, and made a
splendid feast for him. Then the Earl made it known that
he was going to Rome;<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c017'><sup>[278]</sup></a> but when he came to Saxland he
called on the Emperor Heinrek, who received him exceedingly
well, and gave him many valuable presents. He also gave
him many horses, and the Earl rode south to Rome, and saw
the Pope, from whom he obtained absolution for all his sins.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the Earl returned, and arrived safely home in his
dominions. He left off making war expeditions, and
turned his mind to the government of his land and his
people, and to the making of laws. He resided frequently in
Birgishérad (Birsay), and built there Christ’s Kirk, a splendid
church; and there was the first Bishop’s see in the Orkneys.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorfinn’s wife was Ingibiorg, [called] the mother of the
Earls. They had two sons who arrived at manhood; one
was called Paul, the other Erlend. They were men of large
stature, fine-looking, wise, and gentle, more resembling their
mother’s relations. They were much loved by the Earl and
all the people.</p>

</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Thorfinn</span> retained all his dominions to his dying day,
and it is truly said that he was the most powerful of all the
Earls of the Orkneys. He obtained possession of eleven
Earldoms in Scotland, all the Sudreyar (Hebrides), and a
large territory in Ireland. So says Arnór Jarlaskáld—</p>

<p class='c021'>Earl Thorfinn was five winters old when Malcolm<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c017'><sup>[280]</sup></a> the
King of Scots, his mother’s father, gave him the title of Earl,
and after that he was Earl for seventy winters. He died
towards the end of Harald Sigurdson’s reign.<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c017'><sup>[281]</sup></a> He is
buried at Christ’s Kirk in Birgishérad (Birsay), which he
had built. He was much lamented in his hereditary
dominions; but in those parts which he had conquered by
force of arms many considered it very hard to be under his
rule, and [after his death] many provinces which he had
subdued turned away and sought help from the chiefs who
were odal-born to the government of them.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c017'><sup>[282]</sup></a> Then it soon
became apparent how great a loss Thorfinn’s death was to
his dominions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> the sons of Earl Thorfinn succeeded him. Paul was
the elder of the two, and he ruled for both of them. They
did not divide their possessions, yet they almost always
agreed in their dealings.</p>
<p class='c008'>Ingibiorg, the mother of the Earls, was married to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Malcolm, King of Scots,<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c017'><sup>[283]</sup></a> who was called Langháls (Longneck),
and their son was Duncan, King of Scots, the father of
William the excellent man; his son was called William
Odling (the Noble), whom all the Scots wished to have
for their King.<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c017'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Paul, Thorfinn’s son, married the daughter of Earl
Hákon, Ivar’s son, by whom he had many children. They
had a son called Hákon, and a daughter called Thóra, who
was married in Norway to Haldór, son of Brynjúlf Ulfaldi
(camel). Another son of theirs, named Brynjúlf, married
Gyrid, Dag’s daughter. A second daughter of Paul, called
Ingirid, was married to Einar Vorsakrák. Herbiörg was the
third daughter of Paul. She was the mother of Ingibiorg
Ragna, who was married to Sigurd of Westness; their sons were Hákon
Pík, and Brynjúlf. Sigrid was a second daughter of Herbiörg. She was
the mother of Hakon Barn and of Herborg, who was married to Kolbein
Hruga. The fourth daughter of Earl Paul was Ragnhild, who was the
mother of Benidikt, the father of Ingibiorg, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>mother of Erling Erkidiákn (archdeacon). Ragnhild had a
daughter, by name Bergliót, who was married to Hávard,
Gunnar’s son. Their sons were Magnus, Hákon Kló (claw),
Dúfniál, and Thorstein. All those were the families of
Earls and chiefs in the Orkneys, and all of them will be
mentioned in this Saga afterwards. The wife of Earl
Erlend, Thorfinn’s son, was Thóra, the daughter of Sumarlidi,
Ospak’s son; the mother of Ospak was Thórdís, the daughter
of Hall of Sída (in Iceland). Their sons were Erling and
Magnus, and their daughters Gunnhild, and Cecilia, who was
married to Isak, and their sons were Indridi and Kol.
Erling had a natural daughter called Játvör; her son was
Berg.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>HERE IS TOLD OF THE DEATH OF KING HARALD AND HIS DAUGHTER.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>When the brothers Paul and Erlend had succeeded to the
government of the Orkneys, King Harald Sigurdson (Hardradi)
came from Norway with a large army. He first
touched Hjaltland; from thence he went to the Orkneys,
and left there his Queen Ellisif, and their daughters Maria
and Ingigerd. From the Orkneys he had many troops;
both the Earls went with him on the expedition. He went
from Orkney to England, and landed at a place called Klifland
(Cleaveland), and took Skardaborg (Scarborough). Then
he touched at Hallarnes (Holderness), and had a battle there,
in which he was victorious. The Wednesday next before
Matthiasmas (20th September) he had a battle at Jórvík
(York) with the Earls Valthióf and Mórukári. Mórukári
was slain there.<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c017'><sup>[285]</sup></a> Next Sunday the borg at Stamfordbridge
surrendered to him; and he went on shore to
arrange the government of the town; and there he left
his son Olaf, the Earls Paul and Erlend, and his brother-in-law
Eystein Orri. While he was on shore he was met by
Harald Gudinason (Godwinson) at the head of a numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>army. In that battle King Harald Sigurdson fell. After
the death of the King, Eystein Orri and the Earls arrived
from the ship, and made a stout resistance. There Eystein
Orri fell, and almost the whole army of the Northmen with
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the battle King Harald (Godwinson) permitted
Olaf, the son of King Harald Sigurdson, and the Earls to
leave England, with all the troops that had not fled. Olaf
sailed in the autumn from Hrafnseyri<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c017'><sup>[286]</sup></a> to the Orkneys. The
same day and at the same hour as King Harald fell, his
daughter Maria died, and it is said that they had but one life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Olaf spent the winter in the Orkneys, and was very
friendly to the Earls, his kinsmen. Thóra, the mother of
King Olaf, and Ingibiorg, the mother of the Earls, were
daughters of two brothers. In the spring Olaf went to
Norway, and was made King along with his brother Magnus.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the brothers (Paul and Erlend) ruled the Orkneys
they agreed extremely well a long time; but when their
sons came to manhood Erling and Hákon became very
violent. Magnus was the quietest of them all. They were
all men of large stature, and strong, and accomplished in
everything. Hákon, Paul’s son, wished to take the lead among
his brothers; he considered himself of higher birth than the
sons of Erlend, as he was the daughter’s son of Earl Hákon
Ivar’s son, and Ragnhild, the daughter of King Magnus the
Good. Hákon wished his friends to have the lion’s share of
everything before those who leant to the sons of Erlend, but
Erlend did not like his sons to be inferior to any in the
Islands. Matters went so far that the kinsmen could not be
together without danger. Then their fathers persuaded them
to compose their differences. A meeting was appointed,
but it soon became apparent that each [of the fathers]
was inclined to take the part of his sons, and therefore
they did not agree. Thus dissensions arose between the
brothers, and they parted without coming to an agreement,
which was by many considered a great misfortune.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A MEETING OF PEACE.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> this well-disposed men interfered and tried to reconcile
them. A meeting for reconciliation was appointed in
Hrossey,<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c017'><sup>[287]</sup></a> and at that meeting they made peace on the
understanding that the Islands should be divided in two
shares, as they had been between Thorfinn and Brúsi, and
thus matters stood for a while.</p>
<p class='c008'>When Hákon had arrived at the age of manhood he was
continually on war expeditions. He became a very violent
man, and greatly molested those who adhered to Erlend and
his sons; and this went so far that they came to open
enmity a second time, and attacked each other with numerous
troops. Hávard, Gunnar’s son, and all the principal friends
of the Earls, consulted once more and tried to make peace
between them. This time Erlend and his sons refused to
make peace if Hákon remained in the Islands; and because
their friends considered their quarrels so dangerous to themselves,
they besought Hákon not to let the condition that he
should leave the Islands for a time stand in the way of
peace. Then, by the advice of good men, they became
reconciled.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this Hákon left the Islands, and first went east to
Norway, and saw there King Olaf Kyrri (the quiet), and
stayed with him for a while. This was towards the end of
his reign. After that he went east to Sweden to King Ingi,
Steinkel’s son, who received him well. He found friends
and kinsmen there, and was highly honoured on account of
the esteem in which Hákon, his mother’s father, was held.
He had possessions from Steinkel, the King of the Swedes,
ever since he was banished by King Harald, Sigurd’s son,
and became greatly beloved both by the King and the
people. A second daughter’s son of Earl Hákon, Ivar’s son,
was Hákon who was called the Norwegian; he was the
father of King Eirík Spaki (the wise), who was King of
Denmark after Eirík Eymuni (the ever-remembered).</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Hákon remained in Sweden for a while, and was well
treated by King Ingi. But when some time had passed in
this way he felt so home-sick that he wanted to go west again
to the Islands. Christianity then was young, and newly
planted in Sweden. Many men still dabbled in ancient
lore, and were persuaded that by such means they were able
to ascertain future events. King Ingi was a good Christian
man, and loathed all those that meddled in ancient [superstitious]
lore, and made strenuous efforts to abolish the evil
customs which for a long time had accompanied heathenism;
but the chiefs and leading Bœndr murmured loudly
if they were reproved for their evil habits, and at last
matters went so far that the Bœndr elected another King,
Swein, the brother of the Queen, who permitted them to
make sacrifices, and was therefore called “Sacrificing Swein.”
King Ingi had to flee from him to Western Gautland (Gothland);
but their dealings ended thus, that King Ingi caught
Swein by surprise in a house, and burnt the house and
him in it. After this he subdued the whole country, and
uprooted many wicked customs.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE WORDS OF THE SPAE-MAN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Hákon, Paul’s son, was in Sweden he had heard of a
man in that country who practised sorcery and spae-craft,
whether he used for those purposes witchcraft or other
magical arts. Hákon became very curious to see this man,
and anxious to know what he could ascertain about his
future. So he went in search of the man, and at last he
found him in a seaside district, where he went from one
feast to another, and foretold the seasons and other things to
the country people. When Hákon had found this man, he
inquired of him whether he would succeed in regaining his
dominions, or what other fortune awaited him. The spae-man
asked him who he was, and he told him his name and
family—that he was the daughter’s son of Hákon, Ivar’s son.</p>
<p class='c008'>The spae-man then said: “Why should you ask foresight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>or knowledge of the future from me? You know well
that your kinsmen have had little liking for such men as I
am; and yet it might be necessary for you to try to ascertain
your fate from your friend, Olaf the Stout, in whom all your
faith is placed; but I suspect that he would not condescend
to tell you what you are anxious to know, or else he may
not be so mighty as you call him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hákon answered: “I will not reproach him, and I should
rather think I was not worthy to learn wisdom from him,
than that he was incapable; so that I might learn from him
for that matter. But I have come to you, because I thought
that we had no reason to envy each other on account of
virtue or religion.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The spae-man replied: “I am glad to find that you place
your entire trust in me, and not in that faith which you and
your kinsmen profess. Truly they who apply themselves
to such things are strange men. They keep fasts and vigils,
and believe that by such means they will be able to ascertain
that which they desire to know; but the more they
apply themselves to these things, the less they ascertain of
what they wish to know when it is most important to them
to know it. But we undergo no bodily pains, yet we always
obtain knowledge of those things which it is of importance
to our friends not to be ignorant of. Now matters will go
between us in this way, that I shall help you because I
understand that you think you will rather obtain the truth
from me than from the preachers of King Ingi, in whom he
puts his entire trust. After three nights’ time you shall
come to me, and then we shall try whether I may be able
to tell you any of the things you wish to know.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon this they parted, and Hákon stayed in the district.
When three nights had passed, he went again to see
the spae-man. He was in a certain house alone, and groaned
heavily as Hákon entered. He passed his hand across his
forehead, and said that it had cost him much pain to obtain
the knowledge which Hákon desired. Hákon then said he
wished to hear his future.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spae-man said: “If you wish your whole fate unfolded,
it is long to tell, for there is a great future in store
for you, and grand events will happen at certain periods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>your life. I foresee that you will at last become the sole
ruler of the Orkneys; but you will perhaps think you have
long to wait. I also see that your sons will rule there. Your
next journey to the Orkneys will be a very eventful one,
when its consequences appear. In your days you will also
commit a crime,<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c017'><sup>[288]</sup></a> for which you may or may not obtain
pardon from the God in whom you believe. Your steps go
farther out into the world than I am able to trace, yet I
think you will rest your bones in the northern parts. Now
I have told you what has been given me to tell you at this
time, but what satisfaction you may have derived from your
visit rests with yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hákon replied: “Great things you have foretold, if they
turn out to be true; but I think my fate will prove itself
better than you have said; and perhaps you have not seen
the truth.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The spae-man said he was free to believe what he liked
of it, but that such events would not the less surely come
to pass.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE SCHEMES OF HAKON, PAUL’S SON.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> this Hákon went to see King Ingi, and stayed with
him a short while. Then he obtained leave from the King
to depart. He went first to Norway to see his kinsman,
King Magnus, who received him very well. There he
heard that the government of the Orkneys was almost
exclusively in the hands of Earl Erlend and his sons, and
that they were greatly loved, but that his father Paul took
little part in the government. He also thought he could
perceive from conversations with men from the Orkneys,
who gave him a true account of the state of matters, that
the Orkneymen had no desire for his return home. They
were living in peace and quiet, and were afraid that Hákon’s
return would give rise to disturbance and strife. When
Hákon was turning this over in his mind, he thought it
likely that his kinsmen would try to keep him out of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>possessions, and that it would be dangerous for him if he
did not go west with a numerous retinue. Then he devised
a scheme to induce King Magnus to put him into his possessions
in the Orkneys.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>HAKON’S INTERVIEW WITH KING MAGNUS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>This</span> was after King Magnus had put Steigar Thórir and
Egil to death, and put down all opposition to his rule.
Hákon was a sagacious man, and he thought he could
understand from King Magnus’s conversation that he was
ambitious of grand undertakings, and covetous of the possessions
of other rulers. Hákon began to tell the King that
it would be a princely feat to make an expedition to the
west, and subdue the Islands, as Harald the Fairhaired had
done. He also said that if he established his power in the
Sudreyar (Hebrides), he might easily make forays into
Ireland and Scotland from them. Then, having subdued
the western countries, he might attack the English, with the
help of the Northmen, and thus take revenge for his grandfather
Harald, Sigurd’s son.</p>
<p class='c008'>When they were speaking about these things, it became
evident that the King was pleased with this proposal, and
said it was spoken like a nobleman, and quite according to
his own mind. “But I wish you not to be surprised,
Hákon,” said the King, “in case I shall be persuaded by
your words to carry an army into the west, if I put forward
a strong claim to the possessions there, without regard to
the claims of any man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Hákon heard this suggestion, he was not so well
pleased, because he suspected the real meaning of the King’s
words; and after this he no longer persuaded the King to
go; neither was it required, for after their conversation, the
King sent messages throughout his dominions to make
known that he was soon to lead out an expedition, and then
he made it known to the people that he was going to the
west, whatever might be the result.  Preparations were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>made for the expedition throughout the whole kingdom.
King Magnus took with him his son Sigurd, who was eight
winters old, and a hopeful boy.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE WESTERN EXPEDITION OF MAGNUS BARELEGS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> the brothers Paul and Erlend ruled the Orkneys, King
Magnus came from Norway. He had a large army. Many
of his vassals followed him, among whom were Vidkunn
Jonsson, Sigurd Hrani’s son, Serk from Sogn, Dag Eilif’s
son, Skapti from Gizki, Ogmund, Finn and Thórd, Eyvind
Olnbogi (the King’s High Steward), Kali, Snæbiörn’s son
from Agdir, the son of Thorleif Spaki (the wise) who was
maimed by Hallfred, and Kol his son. Kali was a very
wise man, much esteemed by the king, and made verses well.</p>
<p class='c008'>When King Magnus came to the Orkneys, he seized the
Earls Paul and Erlend, and sent them east to Norway, but
placed his son Sigurd over the Isles, and gave him counsellors.
King Magnus went to the Sudreyar (Hebrides),
accompanied by Magnus and Erling, the sons of Earl Erlend,
and Hákon, Paul’s son. But when King Magnus came to
the Islands, he began hostilities first at Liódhús (Lewis), and
gained a victory there. In this expedition he subdued the
whole of the Sudreyar, and seized Lögman, the son of
Gudröd, King of the Western Islands. Thence he went to
Bretland (Wales), and fought a great battle in Anglesea
Sound with two British chiefs<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c017'><sup>[289]</sup></a>—Hugh the Stout and Hugh
the Bold. When the men took up their arms and buckled
for the fight, Magnus, Erlend’s son, sat down on the foredeck,
and did not take his arms. The King asked why he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>do so. He said he had nothing against any one there, and
would not therefore fight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The King said: “Go down below, and do not lie among
other people’s feet if you dare not fight, for I do not believe
that you do this from religious motives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Magnus took a psalter and sang during the battle, and
did not shelter himself. The battle was long and fiercely
contested, and both swords and missiles were used. For a
long time the result of the battle was doubtful. King
Magnus shot from a bow, and a man from Hálogaland<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c017'><sup>[290]</sup></a> was
with him. Hugh the Bold fought valiantly. He had a
suit of armour which covered him entirely, except his eyes.
King Magnus ordered the man from Hálogaland to shoot at
the same time as he did, and they shot both at once. One
of the arrows struck the nose-piece of the helmet, and the
other pierced the eye, and that was said to be the king’s
arrow.</p>

<h3 id='ch-xxx' class='c001'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>KALI’S DEATH.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> Hugh’s death the British (Normans) fled, and King
Magnus obtained a great victory. He lost there many brave
men, and many others were wounded. Kali had received
many wounds, but none mortal. After the battle King
Magnus sailed from the south along the coasts of Bretland
and Scotland, having conquered all the Sudreyar and
Anglesea, which is one-third of Bretland.</p>
<p class='c008'>King Magnus had appointed Magnus, Erlend’s son, as one
of the waiters at his table, and he performed continually the
duties of that office; but after the battle in Anglesea Sound
the king showed that Magnus had incurred his serious displeasure.
He had not been wounded, although he had not
sheltered himself. During the night he stole away from the
King, and hid himself for some time in the woods, while the
King’s men made a search for him. Magnus made his way
to the court of Malcolm,<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c017'><sup>[291]</sup></a> the King of Scots, and remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>there a while. For some time he was with a certain bishop
in Bretland. He was also in England; but he did not come
to the Orkneys while King Magnus was alive.</p>

<p class='c008'>King Magnus held northward, along the coasts of Scotland,
and messengers came to him from Malcolm, the King
of Scots, to ask for peace. They said that the King of Scots
was willing to give him all the islands lying west of Scotland,
between which and the mainland he could pass in a
vessel with the rudder shipped. Thereupon King Magnus
landed in Satiri (Kintyre), and had a boat drawn across the
neck (isthmus) of Satiri,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c017'><sup>[292]</sup></a> he himself holding the helm, and
thus he gained possession of the whole of Satiri, which is
better than the best island of the Sudreyar, Man excepted.
It is in the west of Scotland, and on the land side there is a
narrow isthmus, across which vessels are frequently drawn.
Thence King Magnus went to the Sudreyar, and sent his men
into Scotland’s Fiord.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c017'><sup>[293]</sup></a> They rowed in along one coast and
out along another, and thus took possession of all the islands
west of Scotland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the King made it known that he was going to
spend the winter in the Sudreyar, but gave permission to those
who had most urgent business to go home. When the troops
knew this, they all wished to go home, and murmured greatly
at being longer detained. The King then held a council with
his advisers, and looked at the wounds of his men. He saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Kali, and asked about his wounds. Kali said they did not
heal well, and that he did not know what the end would be.
The King asked for his advice. Kali said: “Is it not so
that your friends are now failing you?” The King said he
did not think so. Kali asked him to hold a wapinschaw,
and thus to ascertain the number of his troops. This the
King did; then he missed many men. This he told to Kali.
Then Kali sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>How do thy great chiefs repay thee</div>
      <div class='line'>For the bounties lavished on them?</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, O King, of this make trial—</div>
      <div class='line'>On western currents ships are shaken.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>The King replied:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Surely it was in my folly</div>
      <div class='line'>That my wealth I gave to these men;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet my long ships, swiftly speeding,</div>
      <div class='line'>Still shall climb the chilly billows.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>After this the King kept a watch to prevent men from
deserting.</p>

<p class='c008'>When King Magnus was in the Sudreyar, he obtained
the hand of Biadmonia, the daughter of Mýrkiartan,<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c017'><sup>[294]</sup></a> the son
of Thiálbi, the King of the Irish in Kunnáttir (Connaught),
for his son Sigurd, who was then nine winters old, and she
five. This winter Kali died from his wounds. Sigurd Sneis
(slice), Kali’s kinsman, a Lenderman from Agdir, had fallen
in Anglesea Sound.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>BIRTH OF KALI, SON OF KOL.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Early</span> in the spring King Magnus left the Sudreyar, and
went first to the Orkneys, where he heard of the death of the
Earls. Erlend died in Nidaros,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c017'><sup>[295]</sup></a> and was buried there; and
Paul died in Biörgvin (Bergen). Then King Magnus married
Gunnhild, the daughter of Earl Erlend, to Kol, Kali’s son, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>order to compensate him for (the loss of) his father. Her
dowry consisted of possessions in the Orkneys, including a
farm at Papul.<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c017'><sup>[296]</sup></a> Some say that Erling, Erlend’s son, fell in
Anglesea Sound, but Snorri Sturluson says he fell in Uladstir<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c017'><sup>[297]</sup></a>
with King Magnus. At his wedding Kol became King
Magnus’s vassal. Afterwards he went to Norway with the
King, and home to Agdir with his wife, and went to reside
at his estates there. Kol and Gunnhild had two children;
their son was called Kali, and their daughter Ingirid. They
were both very promising children, and brought up with
affectionate care.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SIGURD MADE KING.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'>When Magnus had been king nine winters, he went to the
west, and made war in Ireland, and spent the winter in
Kunnáttir (Connaught). The next summer, on St. Bartholomew’s
Day, he fell in Uladstir (Ulster). When Sigurd
heard in the Orkneys of the death of his father, he went
immediately to Norway, and was made king, along with his
brothers Eystein and Olaf. He had left the daughter of
the Irish king in the west.</p>
<p class='c008'>One winter or two after the death of King Magnus,
Hákon, Paul’s son, came from the west, and the kings
gave him an earl’s title and possessions beseeming his birth.
Then he returned to the west and took possession of the
Orkneys. He had always accompanied King Magnus while
he was alive. He was with him in his expedition to Gautland,
which is mentioned in the song made about Hákon,
Paul’s son.</p>
<h3 id='ch-xxxiii' class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MAGNUS (ERLEND’S SON) OBTAINS THE TITLE OF EARL.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Earl Hákon had ruled the Orkneys for some time,
Magnus, the son of Earl Erlend, came from Scotland, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>wished to take possession of his patrimony. The Bœndr
were highly pleased with this, for he was beloved among them,
and had many kinsmen and connections who wished to help
him to his dominions. His mother was married to a man
called Sigurd. Their son was named Hákon Karl (man).
They had estates in Papul. When Earl Hákon heard that
Earl Magnus had come to the Orkneys, he collected men
together, and refused to give up any part of the Islands.
But their friends tried to make peace between them, and at
last they succeeded so far that Hákon consented to give up
half of his dominions if the Kings of Norway approved of it.
Magnus went immediately to Norway to see King Eystein,
for King Sigurd had then gone to Jerusalem.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c017'><sup>[298]</sup></a> King Eystein
received him exceedingly well, and gave up to him his patrimony,
one-half of the Orkneys, with the title of Earl.
Thereupon Magnus went west to his dominions, and his kinsmen
and friends and all the people were glad to see him back.
Through the kind offices of mutual friends, Magnus and
Hákon agreed very well. So long as their friendship continued
there were good times and peace in the Orkneys.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL MAGNUS (ERLEND’S SON).</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> holy Magnus, Earl of the Islands, was a most excellent
man. He was of large stature, a man of a noble
presence and intellectual countenance. He was of blameless
life, victorious in battles, wise, eloquent, strong-minded,
liberal and magnanimous, sagacious in counsels, and more
beloved than any other man. To wise men and good he was
gentle and affable in his conversation; but severe and unsparing
with robbers and vikings. Many of those who
plundered the landowners and the inhabitants of the land
he caused to be put to death. He also seized murderers and
thieves, and punished rich and poor impartially for robberies
and thefts and all crimes. He was just in his judgments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>and had more respect to divine justice than difference in the
estates of men. He gave large presents to chiefs and rich men,
yet the greatest share of his liberality was given to the poor.
In all things he strictly obeyed the divine commands; and
he chastened his body in many things, which in his glorious
life were known to God, but hidden from men. Thus, he
made known his intention to espouse a maiden of a most
excellent family in Scotland, and having celebrated his
marriage, he lived with her for ten winters free from the
defilement of carnal lusts, for he was pure and spotless with
regard to all such sins, and if he were tempted, he bathed in
cold water, and prayed for divine assistance. Many other
glorious virtues he exhibited to God himself, but concealed
from men.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF MAGNUS AND HAKON.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Magnus</span> and Hákon ruled their lands and defended them for
some time, the two agreeing very well. In a song made
about them, it is said that they fought with a chief called
Dúfniál, their third cousin, who fell before them. They
also slew a famous man named Thorbiörn, in Borgarfiord,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c017'><sup>[299]</sup></a> in
Hjaltland. Other deeds of theirs are set forth in song,
though not specially narrated here. When they had ruled
the land for some time, it happened, as often is the case, that
men of evil dispositions were found who destroyed their good
understanding. Hákon was more disposed to listen to these
miserable men, because he was very jealous of the popularity
and greatness of his kinsman Magnus.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL MAGNUS.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Two</span> men with Earl Hákon are chiefly mentioned as being
the worst in creating enmity between the two kinsmen.
These were Sigurd and Sighvat Sokki (sock). Through the
slander of wicked men this enmity went so far that the Earls
gathered troops together and went to meet each other. Both
went to Hrossey, where the Orkney Thingstead<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c017'><sup>[300]</sup></a> was, and
when they arrived there, both drew up their troops in battle
array, and prepared to fight. There were both the Earls and
all the chief men, many (of whom) were friends of both, and
did all they could to make peace between them, showing
much goodwill and virtuous disposition. This meeting was
during Lent. But, as many well-disposed men joined themselves
together to avert hostilities between them, and to
assist neither of them against the other, they confirmed their
reconciliation with oaths and shaking of hands.</p>
<p class='c008'>Some time after this, Earl Hákon, with hypocrisy and
fair words, appointed a day of meeting with the blessed Earl
Magnus, so that their friendship and the newly-made peace
should neither be disturbed nor destroyed. This meeting,
which was to confirm their peace and reconciliation, should
take place in the spring, in the Pasch week, in Egilsey.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c017'><sup>[301]</sup></a>
Earl Magnus was well pleased with this arrangement, as he
thought it was meant to confirm a sincere peace, without any
suspicions, treachery, or covetousness. Each of them should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>have two ships and an equal number of men (at the conference).
Both swore to keep the peace, on conditions dictated
by the wisest men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immediately after Easter, preparations were made for the
meeting. Earl Magnus summoned all those whom he knew
to be best disposed to him, and most likely to make matters
smooth between them. He had two ships, and as many men
as had been agreed upon, and when he was ready he went
to Egilsey. As they were rowing in calm and smooth water
a great wave rose under the ship, which was steered by the
Earl, and broke over it where he sat. His men wondered
very much at such an occurrence,—that a breaker should rise
in smooth water where no man could remember a breaker to
have arisen, and where the water was so deep. Then the
Earl said: “No wonder that you are surprised at this.
Indeed, I take this as a foreboding of my death. Perhaps
it will come to pass as was prophesied about Earl Hákon,
and this may be to prepare us for Hákon, my kinsman, not
dealing honestly with me at this meeting.” The Earl’s men
became very sorrowful when he spoke of his death being
near at hand, and begged him to take care of his life, and
not to trust himself to the good faith of Earl Hákon. Earl
Magnus answered: “Let us go this time, and let all that
depends on our journey be in God’s will.”</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL HAKON AND EARL MAGNUS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> it is to be told of Earl Hákon that he gathered together
a numerous army, and had many ships equipped as if for
battle. And when the troops were assembled, he made
known to his men that he intended that this meeting should
decide between him and Earl Magnus, so that both of them
should not rule over the Orkneys. Many of his men
approved of this plan, adding many wicked suggestions to
it, yet Sigurd and Sighvat Sokki counselled the worst things.</p>
<p class='c008'>Then they began to row fast, and went along quickly.
Hávard, Gunnar’s son, who was the friend and counsellor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the Earls, and equally faithful to both, was on board the
Earl’s ship. Hákon had concealed this wicked plan from
him, in which he would by no means have had any part.
And when he knew that the Earl was so resolute in this
wicked purpose, he jumped overboard, and swam to a certain
uninhabited island.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Magnus arrived first with his men at Egilsey, and
when they saw Earl Hákon coming they perceived that he
had eight war-ships. Then Earl Magnus suspected that he
intended to act treacherously towards him. So he walked
along the island with his men, and went into the church to
pray. His men offered to defend him. The Earl replied:
“I will not put your lives in danger for mine, and if peace
cannot be established between us, let it be as God wills.”
His men now recognised the truth of his words, and as he
foreknew the hours of his life—whether from his wisdom or
from a divine revelation—he would neither fly nor avoid his
enemies. He prayed devoutly, and had a mass sung for him.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE OFFERS OF EARL MAGNUS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Hakon</span> and his men came up in the morning, and ran first
to the church and ransacked it, but did not find the Earl.
He had gone to another part of the island, to a certain hiding-place,
accompanied by two men. But when the holy Earl
Magnus saw that they searched for him, he called to them,
and thus made known to them where he was, and said they
need search no farther. And when Hákon saw him, he and
his men ran thither with loud yelling and clangour of their
weapons.</p>
<p class='c008'>Earl Magnus was praying when they came up to him,
and when he had finished his prayer he made the sign
of the cross, and said firmly to Earl Hákon: “You did not
act well, kinsman, when you broke your oaths, and it is
highly probable that you were instigated to this more by the
wickedness of others than your own. Now, I will make you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>three offers, that you may rather accept one of them than
break your oaths, and slay me who am innocent.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hákon’s men asked what these offers were.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The first is, that I shall go to Rome, or away to Jerusalem,
and visit the holy places, taking with me two ships
from the Orkneys, with the necessary equipment for the
journey, and obtain benefits for the souls of us both. I shall
swear never to return to the Orkneys.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This offer was promptly rejected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then said Earl Magnus: “Now, because my life is in
your power, and I have offended against Almighty God in
many things, you shall send me to Scotland, to our mutual
friends, and keep me in custody there, with two men for
companionship. Make such provision that I shall not be
able to escape from this custody.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This too was promptly refused.</p>

<p class='c008'>Magnus then said: “There is yet one more offer which
I will make, and God knows that I think more of your soul
than of my own life, for it were better that you should do as I
shall offer you than that you should take my life. Let me
be maimed as you like, or deprived of my eyes, and throw
me into a dark dungeon.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then said Earl Hákon: “This offer I accept, and I ask
for no more.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But the chiefs started up and said to Earl Hákon: “One
of you will we kill now, and from this day you shall not
both rule the lands of the Orkneys.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Hákon replied: “Slay him then, for I will rather
have earldom and lands than instant death.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus their conversation was related by Höldbodi, a truthful
Bondi in the Sudreyar, who was one of the two of Earl
Magnus’s men who were with him when he was taken.</p>
<h3 id='ch-xxxix' class='c001'>CHAPTER XXXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE BEHEADING OF EARL MAGNUS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> worthy Earl Magnus was as cheerful as if he were
invited to a banquet, and spoke neither words of offence nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>anger. After these words had passed, he fell on his knees
to pray, hiding his face in his hands, and shedding many
tears before God. Then, when the holy Earl Magnus was
thus doomed to death, Hákon ordered his banner-bearer,
Ofeig, to slay the Earl, but he refused, with the utmost
wrath. Then forced he Lífólf, his cook, to be the slayer of
Magnus, but he began to weep aloud. “Weep not thus,”
said Earl Magnus, “for this is an honourable task. Be
firm, and you shall have my clothing, according to the
custom and laws of the men of old. Be not afraid, for you
do this against your will, and he who forces you sins more
than you.”</p>
<p class='c008'>When he had said this, he took off his tunic and gave it
to Lífólf. Then he asked for permission to pray, which was
granted to him. He fell upon the earth, and gave himself
to God, offering himself as a sacrifice. He prayed not only
for his friends, but also for his enemies and murderers, and
forgave them, with all his heart, their offences against himself.
He confessed his sins to God, and prayed that they
might be washed from him in the shedding of his blood.
He commended his spirit to God’s keeping, and prayed that
His angels might come to meet his soul and carry it into the
rest of paradise. Some say that he took the sacrament when
the mass was sung. Then, when God’s friend was led to
execution, he said to Lífólf: “Stand before me, and hew me
a mighty stroke on the head, for it is not fitting that high-born
lords should be put to death like thieves. Be firm,
poor man, for I have prayed to God for you, that he may
have mercy upon you.” After that he signed the sign of
the cross, and stooped under the blow, and his spirit passed
into heaven.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XL<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SAINTSHIP OF EARL MAGNUS MADE MANIFEST.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> place where Earl Magnus was slain was previously
covered with moss and stones, but shortly afterwards his
merits before God became manifest in this wise, that it became
green sward where he was beheaded.  Thus God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>showed that he had suffered for righteousness’ sake, and had
obtained the beauty and verdure of paradise, which is called
the land of the living.</p>
<p class='c008'>Earl Hákon did not permit his body to be brought to
the church (for burial).</p>

<p class='c008'>The day of Earl Magnus’s death was two days after
Tiburtiusmas (14th April). Then he had been seven
winters Earl in the Orkneys along with Earl Hákon.
Seventy-four winters had passed since the death of King
Olaf. The Kings of Norway were at this time Sigurd,
Eystein, and Olaf. It was one thousand and ninety-one
winters after the birth of Christ.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c017'><sup>[302]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE EARL’S BODY BROUGHT TO CHURCH.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Thora</span>, the mother of Earl Magnus, had invited both the
Earls to a banquet after their meeting, and Earl Hákon went
there after the murder of the holy Earl Magnus. Thóra
herself served at the banquet, and brought the drink to the
Earl and his men who had been present at the murder of her
son. And when the drink began to have effect on the Earl,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>then went Thóra before him and said: “You came alone here,
my lord, but I expected you both. Now, I hope you will
gladden me in the sight of God and men. Be to me in stead
of a son, and I shall be to you in stead of a mother. I
stand greatly in need of your mercy now, and (I pray you
to) permit me to bring my son to church. Hear this my
supplication now, as you wish God to look upon you at the
day of doom.”</p>
<p class='c008'>The Earl became silent, and considered her case, as she
prayed so meekly, and with tears, that her son might be
brought to church. He looked upon her, and the tears fell,
and he said, “Bury your son where it pleases you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the Earl’s body was brought to Hrossey, and
buried at Christ’s Kirk (in Birsay), which had been built by
Earl Thorfinn.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE MIRACLE-WORKING OF MAGNUS THE MARTYR.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Soon</span> after this a heavenly light was seen above his burial-place.
Then men who were placed in danger began to pray
to him, and their prayers were heard. A heavenly odour
was frequently perceived above his burial-place, from which
people suffering from illness received health. Then sufferers
made pilgrimages thither both from the Orkneys and Hjaltland,
and kept vigils at his grave, and were cured of all their
sufferings.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c017'><sup>[303]</sup></a> But people dared not make this known while

<p class='c007'>William was Bishop of the Orkneys at this time. He was
the first bishop there. The bishop’s seat was at Christ’s
Kirk in Birgishérad (Birsay). William was bishop for six
winters of the seventh decade.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c017'><sup>[304]</sup></a> For a long time he disbelieved
in the sanctity of Earl Magnus, until his merits
became manifest to such a degree that God made his holiness
grow the more conspicuous the more it was tried, as is
told in the book of his miracles.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE JOURNEY OF EARL HAKON TO THE SOUTH.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> the murder of Earl Magnus, Hákon, Paul’s son, took
possession of all the Orkneys, and exacted an oath of fealty
from all men, and took submission from those who had
served Earl Magnus. He became a great chief, and made
heavy exactions from those of Earl Magnus’s friends who in
his opinion had taken part against him.</p>
<p class='c008'>Some winters after this he prepared to leave the country,
and went to Rome. Then he also went to Jerusalem, according
to the custom of the palmers, and brought away
sacred relics, and bathed in the river Jordan. After that
he returned to his dominions, and resumed the government
of the Orkneys. He became a good ruler, and established
peace throughout his dominions; he also made new laws for
the Orkneys, which the landowners liked better than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>former ones. Then he became so popular that the Orkneymen
desired no other rulers than Hákon and his issue.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>GENEALOGICAL.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Earl Hákon ruled over the Orkneys there lived a noble
and wealthy man, by name Moddan, at Dal (Dale), in Caithness.
His daughters were Helga and Frákork Thórleif. Helga,
Moddan’s daughter, was the concubine of Earl Hákon, and
their son was Harald, who was called Sléttmáli (smooth-talker),
and their daughter was Ingibiorg, who was married to Olaf
Bitling (little bit), the King of the Sudreyar. Their second
daughter was Margarét. Moddan’s daughter, Frákork, was
married to a man who was named Liót Níding (miscreant),
in Sutherland, and their daughter was Steinvör the Stout,
who was married to Thorliót, at Rekavík.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c017'><sup>[305]</sup></a> Their sons were
Olvir Rosta (strife), Magnus Orm, and Moddan Eindridi, and
their daughter Audhild. A second daughter of Frákork was
Gudrún, married to Thorstein Höld, Fiaransmunn (open-mouth).
Their son was Thorbiörn Klerk (clerk).</p>
<p class='c008'>Hákon, Paul’s son, had a son named Paul, who was called
Umálgi (speechless); he was a reserved man, but popular.
When the brothers grew up they never agreed. Hákon,
Paul’s son, died on a sick-bed in the Islands, and his death
was considered a great loss, for in the later days of his
reign there was unbroken peace, and the Islanders suspected
that the brothers would not agree well.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SLAYING OF THORKEL FÓSTRI.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> the death of Earl Hákon, his sons succeeded him;
but they soon disagreed, and divided the dominions between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>them. Then also dissensions arose between the great men,
and the vassals of each were divided into factions. Earl
Harald held Caithness from the King of the Scots, and he
resided frequently there, but sometimes also in Scotland
(Sutherland?), for he had many friends and kinsmen there.</p>
<p class='c008'>When Earl Harald was staying in Sutherland there came
to him a man called Sigurd Slembir,<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c017'><sup>[306]</sup></a> who was said to be
the son of the priest Adalbrekt. He came from Scotland,
having been staying with King David, who had held him in
high esteem. Earl Harald received him extremely well.
Sigurd went into the Islands with Earl Harald and Frákork,
Moddan’s daughter, for her husband, Liót Níding, was dead.
She and her sister took a large share in the government with
Earl Harald. Sigurd Slembir was a great favourite with all
of them. At that time Audhild, the daughter of Thórleif,
Moddan’s daughter, was his concubine. Afterwards she was
married to Hákon Kló (claw). Before that time she had
been married to Eirík Stræta; their son was Eirík
Slagbrellir.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Sigurd and Frákork came to the Islands great
dissensions arose, and both of the Earls called together as
many of their friends as they could get. The most attached
to Earl Paul was Sigurd, at Westness,<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c017'><sup>[307]</sup></a> who had married Ingibiorg
the Noble, a kinswoman of the Earls’, and Thorkel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Sumarlidi’s son, who was always with Earl Paul, and was
called his foster-father. He was a kinsman of the holy
Earl Magnus, and a most popular man. The friends of the
Earl thought that no man would less deplore their dissensions
than Thorkel, because of the injury done him by their
father Hákon. At last Earl Harald and Sigurd Slembir
went to Thorkel Fóstri,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c017'><sup>[308]</sup></a> and slew him. When Earl Paul
heard this, he was very much displeased, and gathered men
together; but when their mutual friends became aware of
this, they went between them and tried to reconcile them;
and all took part in making peace. Earl Paul was so
wroth that he would not make peace, unless all those who
were concerned in the manslaying were banished. But as
the islanders thought their dissensions a great calamity,
they all tried to pacify them; and the result was that
Sigurd and all those who, in Earl Paul’s opinion, were most
concerned in this crime, were banished from the Orkneys.
Earl Harald paid the manbote (compensation) for the slaughter
of Thorkel. The terms of this peace were that their friendship
should be confirmed, and that they should spend Christmas
and all the chief festivals together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sigurd Slembir left the Orkneys, and went to Scotland,
and stayed for a while with Malcolm, King of Scots, and
was well entertained. He was thought a great man in all
manly exercises. He remained for a time in Scotland, until
he went to Jerusalem.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL HARALD SLAIN BY SORCERY.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Once</span> the brothers were to be entertained at Orfjara (Orphir),
one of Earl Harald’s estates, and he was to bear the expense
of the entertainment for both of them that Christmas. He
was very busy, and made great preparations. The sisters
Frákork and Helga were there with the Earl, and sat sewing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>in a little room.<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c017'><sup>[309]</sup></a> Earl Harald went into the room where
the sisters were sitting on a cross-bench, and saw a linen
garment, newly made, and white as snow, lying between
them. The Earl took it up, and saw that it was embroidered
with gold. He asked, “To whom does this splendid thing
belong?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Frákork replied, “It is intended for your brother Paul.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why do you make such a fine garment for him? You
do not take such pains in making my clothing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He had just come out of bed, and was dressed in a
shirt and linen drawers, and had thrown a mantle over his
shoulders. He threw off the mantle, and spread out the
dress. His mother took hold of it, and asked him not to
envy his brother of his fine clothing. The Earl pulled it
from her, and prepared to put it on. Then Frákork snatched
off her head-gear, and tore her hair, and said that his life
was at stake if he put it on, and both of the women wept
grievously. The Earl put on the garment nevertheless; but as
soon as it touched his sides a shiver went through his body,
which was soon followed by great pain, so that he had to
take to his bed; and he was not long in bed until he died.
His friends considered his death a great loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immediately after his death his brother Paul took possession
of his dominions, with the consent of the Bœndr.
Earl Paul considered that the splendid underclothing which
Earl Harald had put on had been intended for him, and
therefore he did not like the sisters to stay in the Orkneys.
So they left the Islands with all their attendants, and went
first to Caithness, and then to Scotland to the estate which
Frákork had there. Her son Erlend was brought up there
while he was young. Olvir Rosta, the son of Thorliót, from
Rekavík (Rackwick), and Steinný (Steinvor?), Frákork’s
daughter, were also brought up there. Olvir was a man of
great strength, a violent man and a great fighter. Thorbiörn
Klerk, the son of Thorstein Höld, was brought up there,
and also Margarét, the daughter of Earl Hákon and Helga,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Moddan’s daughter, and Eirík Slagbrellir. All these were
men of great families, and accomplished, and thought they
had claims to the Orkneys. The brothers of Frákork were
Magnus Orfi (the liberal) and Earl Ottar, in Thórsey (Thurso),
who was a noble man.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL PAUL.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Paul</span> then ruled the Orkneys, and was very popular.
He was somewhat taciturn, spoke little at the Things, and
gave others a large share in the government with himself.
He was a modest man, and gentle to the people, liberal with
his money, and spared nothing with his friends. He was not
warlike, and kept himself very quiet. At that time there
were many noble men descended from Earls in the Orkneys.
Then there lived at Westness, in Hrólfsey (Rousay), a noble
man, by name Sigurd, who had married Ingibiorg the Noble.
Her mother Herborg was the daughter of Earl Paul, Thorfinn’s
son. Their sons were Brynjúlf and Hákon Pík (peak). All
these were Earl Paul’s vassals; so were also the sons of
Hávard, Gunni’s son—Hákon Kló, Thorstein, and Dûfniáll.
Their mother was Bergliót, and her mother was Ragnhild,
the daughter of Earl Paul. There was a man named Erling,
who lived in Caithness. He had four sons, all of them
accomplished men. A man named Olaf lived in Gáreksey
(Gairsay), and had another estate at Dungalsbæ, in
Caithness. Olaf was a great man, and highly honoured by
Earl Paul. His wife was named Asleif, a wise woman,
accomplished, and of a great family. Their sons—Valthióf,
Swein, and Gunni—were all accomplished men. Their sister
was named Ingigerd. Sigurd, the Earl’s brother-in-law, had
married Thóra, the mother of Earl Magnus, and their son
was Hákon Karl (man). Both Sigurd and his son were
great chiefs. In Rínarsey (North Ronaldsay) there lived a
woman, by name Ragna, and her son was named Thorstein,
a man of great strength. A farmer named Kugi, a wise and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>wealthy man, lived at Gefsisness,<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c017'><sup>[310]</sup></a> in Westrey. A farmer
named Helgi lived at a hamlet in Westrey. Thorkel Flétta
(a braid), a violent and powerful man, lived in Westrey.
Thorstein and Haflidi were unpopular men. At Swiney
(Swona), in the Pentland Firth, lived a poor man, and his
sons were Asbiörn and Margad, sturdy fellows. In Fridarey
(Fair Isle) lived a man by name Dagfinn. A man named
Thorstein lived at Fluguness,<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c017'><sup>[311]</sup></a> in Hrossey (the Mainland of
Orkney), and his sons were Thorstein Krôkauga (crooked
eye) and Blán, both of them wild fellows. Játvör, the
daughter of Earl Erlend, and her son Borgar, lived at Knarrarstadir;<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c017'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
they were rather unpopular. Jón Vœng (wing)
lived at Uppland, in Háey (Hoy). Rikgard lived at Brekkur,<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c017'><sup>[313]</sup></a>
in Straumsey. They were poor men, and relatives of
Olaf Hrólfsson. A man named Grímkell lived at Glettuness.<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c017'><sup>[314]</sup></a>
All these men will be mentioned in the saga
afterwards.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XLIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF KALI, WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME AN EARL.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Kol</span>, who was a very wise man, resided on his estates at
Agdir (in Norway), and did not go to the Orkneys. His son
Kali grew up there, and was a most promising man. He
was of middle size, well proportioned, and very handsomely
shaped; his hair was of a light auburn colour. He was very
affable and popular, and highly accomplished. He made the
following verses:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At the game-board I am skilful;</div>
      <div class='line'>Knowing in no less than nine arts;</div>
      <div class='line'>Runic lore I well remember;</div>
      <div class='line'>Books I like; with tools I’m handy;</div>
      <div class='line'>Expert am I on the snow-shoes,</div>
      <div class='line'>With the bow, and pull an oar well;</div>
      <div class='line'>And, besides, I am an adept</div>
      <div class='line'>At the harp, and making verses.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Kali was frequently with his kinsman Sölmund, the son
of Sigurd Sneis. He was treasurer at Túnsberg, and had
estates at Austragdir. He was a great chief, and had a
numerous retinue.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER L<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF KALI AND GILLICHRIST.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Kali was fifteen winters old, he went with some
merchants to England, taking with him a good (cargo of)
merchandise. They went to a trading place called Grímsbœ
(Grimsby). There was a great number of people from Norway,
as well as from the Orkneys, Scotland, and the Sudreyar.
Kali met there a man who was called Gillichrist. The latter
asked Kali about many things in Norway, and spoke chiefly
with him, so that they became companions. Then he told
Kali in confidence that his name was Harald,<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c017'><sup>[315]</sup></a> that Magnus
Barelegs was his father, and his mother was in the Sudreyar.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>He further asked him how he would be received in Norway
if he came there. Kali said that he thought King Sigurd
would be likely to receive him well, if others did not set him
against him. Gillichrist and Kali exchanged presents, and at
parting they promised each other mutual friendship wherever
they might meet.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF KALI AND JON.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> that Kali went from the west in the same ship.
They touched at Agdir, and from there they went to Biörgvin
(Bergen). Then he made a stanza:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Unpleasantly we have been wading</div>
      <div class='line'>In the mud a weary five weeks.</div>
      <div class='line'>Dirt we had indeed in plenty,</div>
      <div class='line'>While we lay in Grimsby harbour;</div>
      <div class='line'>But now on the moor of sea-gulls</div>
      <div class='line'>Ride we o’er the crests of billows,</div>
      <div class='line'>Gaily as the elk of bowsprits</div>
      <div class='line'>Eastward ploughs its way to Bergen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>When they came to the town, there was a great number of
people from the north and the south (of Norway), and from
foreign lands, who had brought much merchandise. The
crew of the ship went to some public places to amuse themselves.
Kali was a great dandy, and made a great display,
as he was newly arrived from England. He thought a great
deal of himself, and many others thought a great deal of him
too, because he was of a good family, and highly accomplished.
In the inn where he sat drinking there was a man
named Jón Pétrsson, the son of Serk, from Sogn. He was
the king’s vassal at the time. His mother was Helga, the
daughter of Hárek, from Setr. Jón was a great dandy too.
The dame who kept the inn where they were drinking was
Unn by name, a woman of good repute. Jón and Kali soon
became companions, and parted great friends. Whereupon
Jón went home to his estates, and Kali went to his father,
Kol, at Agdir. Kali stayed frequently with his kinsman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Sölmund. Thus some years passed, in which Kali made
trading trips during the summer, and spent the winters at
home or with Sölmund.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>KALI GOES INTO DOLLS CAVE.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>One</span> summer Kali went to Thrándheim; he was detained by
weather in an island called Dolls, and there was a cave called
Dollshellir. It was said that money was hidden there.
The merchants went into the cave, and found it very difficult
to penetrate into it. They came to a sheet of water stretching
across the cave, and no one dared to cross it except Kali,
and one of Sölmund’s domestics called Hávard. They swam
across the lake, having a rope between them. Kali also
carried firewood and fire-making gear between his shoulders.
They came to the opposite shore, which was rugged and
stony; the smell also was there very bad, so that they could
hardly make a light. Kali said they should not go any
farther, and piled up stones as a monument. Then Kali
sang a song:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here I raise a mighty stone-pile,</div>
      <div class='line'>In remembrance of our daring,</div>
      <div class='line'>In this Dolls cave, dark and gloomy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where we sought the goblins’ treasure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet I know not how the captain</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the ocean’s gliding snow-skates</div>
      <div class='line'>May re-cross the dismal water:</div>
      <div class='line'>Long and dreary is the journey.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then they returned, and came safe to their men, and it is not
mentioned that anything else happened during their journey.
When they came to Biörgvin, Kali went to the same inn, to
Dame Unn. Jón Pétrsson was there, and one of his domestics,
by name Brynjúlf. Many other men were also there,
although their names are not mentioned here.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF HAVARD AND BRYNJULF.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>One</span> evening, when Jón and Kali had gone to bed, many
remained drinking, and talked a great deal. The guests
were getting drunk, and at last they began comparing men,<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c017'><sup>[316]</sup></a>
and disputing about who were the greatest of the landed
men of Norway. Brynjúlf said that Jón Pétrsson was the
best man, and of the noblest family of all the young men
south of Stád. Hávard, the companion of Kali, spoke of
Sölmund, and said that he was in nothing inferior to Jón,
adding that the men of Vík would esteem him more than
Jón. Out of this a great quarrel arose, and as the ale spoke
in them, they kept so little within bounds that Hávard
jumped up, took a piece of wood, and struck Brynjúlf a blow
on the head, so that he fainted. Those present took hold of
Brynjúlf, and sent Hávard away to Kali, who again sent him
to a priest called Rikgard, in Alvidra. “And tell him from
me,” said Kali, “to keep you till I come to the east.” Kali
sent a man with him, and they rowed to the south till they
came to Grœningiasund. Then Hávard said to his fellow-traveller:
“Now, as we are out of their reach, let us rest
ourselves, and lie down to sleep.”</p>
<p class='c008'>When Brynjúlf recovered, he was conducted to Jón, and
he told him all that had happened, and also that the man
had been sent away. Jón guessed the truth about Hávard’s
destination, and ordered ten men, led by Brynjúlf, to take a
rowing boat, in which they rowed till they came to Grœningiasund,
and by that time it was daylight. They saw a boat
on the beach. Brynjúlf said: “Perhaps these men may be
able to tell us something of Hávard.” Then they went up
and found them when they had just woke up. Brynjúlf and
his men attacked them immediately with arms, and Hávard
and his companion were both slain. After this they returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>to the town and told the news to Jón, and then it was known
to the whole town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kali considered these slaughters a great offence against
himself; and when mediators went between him and Jón,
the latter said that he would leave to him to say what
amends he wished for the offence, without prejudice to the
right of the King and the parties to the suit. Kali agreed
to this, yet they were no friends from this time. Kali went
home after this occurrence, and when he saw his father he
told him the news and the result.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Kol said: “I think your judgment was rather
strange, in that you should have agreed to any terms of reconciliation
before Sölmund knew. I think your position is
difficult, and that you can do little else than try to be reconciled.
But Sölmund would not have acted like you if your
man had been killed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kali replied: “I suppose it is true, father, that I have
judged rather hastily in this matter, and you were too far
away to advise me. It will often appear that I am not so
deeply wise as you. But I thought that Sölmund had not
a better chance of gaining honourable amends, though I refused
what was offered to me. And I consider it no dishonour
for you and Sölmund if he offers to allow you to
determine your compensation, though I doubt whether such
an offer will be made. But I consider myself under no
obligation to Brynjúlf, while I have made no award and no
money has been received.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Father and son had a long talk about this, and did not
agree; then they sent men to tell Sölmund the news.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF JON AND SOLMUND.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> that, Kol and Kali had an interview with Sölmund.
Kol wished to send men to Jón to try to make peace between
them; but Sölmund and Hallvard, Hávard’s brother, refused
everything but blood-revenge, and said it was not becoming to
ask for settlement. Yet Kol’s advice was taken, because he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>promised not to withdraw from the case until Sölmund had
received honourable amends; and Kol was to lay all the
plans. When the messengers returned, they said they had
received a most unfavourable reply to their demands, and
that Jón refused positively to make compensation for a man
who by his own act had forfeited his personal security.
Sölmund said that this had turned out just as he expected—namely,
that little honour would be gained by asking Jón for
settlement; and then he begged Kol to propose a plan that
might be of some avail.</p>
<p class='c008'>Kol replied: “Is Hallvard willing to run any risk in
order to avenge his brother, even though it may come to
little?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hallvard said he would not spare himself in order to
take revenge, even if there were danger connected with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then,” said Kol, “you shall go secretly to Sogn, to a
man called Uni, who lives not far from Jón. He is a wise
man, but rather poor, for he has been a long time oppressed
by Jón; he is a great friend of mine, and considerably
advanced in years. You shall take to him from me six
marks (of silver) weighed, in order that he may give you
advice how to take revenge on Brynjúlf, or some other of
Jón’s men, whom he considers not less a loss to him. And
if this can be brought about, Uni shall send you to my kinsman
Kyrpinga Orm, at Studla, and his sons Ogmund and
Erling, and there I consider you will be as if you were at
home. Tell Uni to sell his farm and come to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hallvard prepared to go, and we are not told of his
journey or night quarters, until he came to Uni one evening.
He did not tell his true name. They inquired of each other
for current news; and in the evening, when they were sitting
round the fire, the guest asked a great deal about noble men
in Sogn and Hördaland. Uni said that none of the landed
men were considered more powerful than Jón, on account
of his family and his violence; and he further asked whether
they had no experience of it in the south. When he had
said this, the guest became silent. Then the people arose
from the fire, and the two remained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Uni said: “Did not you say just now that your
name was Hallvard?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“No,” said the guest; “I called myself Saxi this evening.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uni said: “Then I am out of all difficulties; but if my
name were Brynjúlf, I should think yours was Hallvard;
and now let us go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The guest took hold of him and said: “Let us not go
yet.” Whereupon he delivered the purse, and said: “Kol
sends you his greeting and this silver, in order that you may
be willing to advise me how to avenge my brother Havard
on Brynjúlf.” Then he told him Kol’s plans.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uni said: “Kol deserves well of me, but I cannot know
what may be done about the revenge on Brynjúlf; but he is
expected here to-morrow to fetch his concubine’s clothes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thereafter he went with Hallvard to a stable which
stood opposite the door of the house, and concealed him in
the manger. This was before the people got up, but he had
slept in the house during the night. When Hallvard had
been a little while in the stable, he saw a brisk man coming
to the house. He called into the house, and told the woman
to make herself ready. She took her clothes and brought
them out. Then Hallvard thought he knew who the man
was, and walked out. Brynjúlf had put down his weapons
while he was tying the clothes; and when Hallvard met him
he dealt him a deadly blow, and returned to the stable and
hid himself. While the slaughter was being committed the
woman had gone into the house to take leave of the inmates,
but when she came out she saw what had occurred, and ran
in crying and frightened to such a degree that she was nearly
fainting, and told the news. Farmer Uni ran out, and
said that the man had probably been an assassin. He despatched
a man to tell Jón the news, and urged his men with
great eagerness to search for the murderer; therefore no one
suspected him. Hallvard remained in the stable until the
search had slackened. Then he went, with Uni’s advice,
to Orm and his sons at Studla, and they sent men with him
to the east. Kol and Sölmund received him well, and were
then well satisfied with their case. After a while the truth
came out, and Jón was very much grieved. Thus that year
passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next winter, towards Yuletide, Jón left his home with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>thirty men, saying that he was going to pay his uncle Olaf
a visit. This he did, and was very well received. Jón told
his uncle that he was going to Agdir to see Sölmund. Olaf
dissuaded him from it, and said that he had held his own
though they parted as matters stood then. But Jón said he
was not satisfied to let Brynjúlf remain unavenged. Olaf
said he thought he would gain very little by trying; yet he
had from there thirty men, and thus he went with half a
hundred men across the hills, intending to take Sölmund and
Kol by surprise. When Jón had just gone from the north,
Uni went in haste to Orm and his sons at Studla, and they
sent men with him to Kol. He arrived there at Yule,
and told them that Jón was going to attack them. Kol
despatched scouts immediately to all parts where Jón was
expected; and he himself went to see Sölmund, and they
and their kinsmen waited with a great number of men about
them. They had news of Jón’s movements, and started
immediately to meet him. They met at a certain wood, and
the fight began immediately. Kol’s men were much more
numerous, and came off victorious. Jón lost many men, and
fled into the wood. He was wounded in the leg, and this
wound healed so badly that he was lame ever after, and was
called Jón Fót (leg). He came to the north during Lent,
and his expedition was considered rather ignominious. The
winter thus passed, but the next summer Jón caused two of
Kol’s kinsmen to be killed, Gunnar and Aslák.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE RECONCILIATION OF THE ORKNEYMEN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Shortly</span> afterwards King Sigurd came to the town, and these
difficulties were laid before him. Then the King summoned
both to appear before him, and they came accompanied by
their kinsmen and friends. An attempt was made to reconcile
them, and the result was, that the King should judge all
their differences, which both parties confirmed by shaking of
hands. King Sigurd, assisted by the advice of the wisest
men, then made peace between them. One part of the agreement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>was, that Jón Pétrsson should marry Ingirid, Kol’s
daughter, and their friendship should be confirmed by the
connection. The killed were set off against each other. The
attack on Kol, and Jón’s wound, were set off against the loss
of men in the east. Further wounds were matched, and the
difference made up. Each should assist the other, both at
home and abroad. As a result of this reconciliation, King
Sigurd gave Kali, Kol’s son, the half of the Orkneys, jointly
with Paul, Hákon’s son, and made him an Earl at the same
time. He also gave him the name of Earl Rögnvald, Brúsi’s
son, because his mother, Gunnhild, said that Rögnvald was
the most accomplished of all the Orkney Earls, and thought
the name would bring good fortune. This part of the
Orkneys had belonged to Earl Magnus, Kali’s mother’s
brother. After this reconciliation, they who were enemies
before parted good friends.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>KING SIGURD’S DEATH.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>This</span> winter King Sigurd resided in Osló.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c017'><sup>[317]</sup></a> During Lent he
was taken ill, and died one night after Lady-day. His son
Magnus was in the town, and held a Thing, and was accepted
king throughout the land, agreeably to the oaths which the
inhabitants had sworn to King Sigurd. He also took possession
of all the royal treasures.</p>
<p class='c008'>Harald Gilli was at Túnsberg when he heard of the death
of King Sigurd. He had meetings with his friends, and sent
for Rögnvald and his father, because they had always been
friends since they met in England. Rögnvald and his father
had also done most to help Harald to prove his paternity to
Sigurd. In this they were assisted by many barons; among
others Ingimar, Swein’s son, and Thióstólf, Ali’s son.
Harald and his party resolved to hold the Hauga-Thing<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c017'><sup>[318]</sup></a> at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>Túnsberg, and there Harald was accepted king of one-half of
the land. The oaths with which he had given up his patrimony
in order to be permitted to prove his paternity by an
ordeal<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c017'><sup>[319]</sup></a> were said to have been given under compulsion.
Then people flocked to him, and gave in their allegiance,
and soon he had many men about him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Messages went between him and King Magnus, but it
was not until four winters had passed that they were reconciled,
on the terms that each of them should have one-half of
the kingdom; but King Magnus had the long ships, and the
table-service, and all the treasures (of his father), yet he was
dissatisfied with his portion, and showed enmity to all the
friends of King Harald. King Magnus would not hold valid
King Sigurd’s gift of the Orkneys and the earldom to Rögnvald,
because he was the firmest partisan of King Harald,
until all their dealings were concluded. Magnus and Harald
were three winters Kings of Norway, and nominally at peace,
but the fourth summer they fought at Fyrileif,<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c017'><sup>[320]</sup></a> where King
Magnus had nearly 6000, but Harald only 1500 men. These
chiefs were with King Harald: his brother Kriströd, Earl
Rögnvald, Ingimar from Ask, Thióstólf Ali’s son, and Sölmund.
King Magnus gained the victory, and Harald fled.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Kriströd and Ingimar were killed. Ingimar made the following
stanza:—</p>

      <div class='line'>Ne’er to Ask shall I return.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>King Harald fled to his ships in Vík,<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c017'><sup>[322]</sup></a> and went to Denmark
to King Eirik Eymuni,<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c017'><sup>[323]</sup></a> who gave him Halland for his
maintenance, and eight long ships without rigging. Thióstólf,
Ali’s son, sold his lands, bought ships and arms, and
went in autumn to King Harald, in Denmark. At Yuletide
King Harald came to Biörgvin, and lay in Flóruvagár till
after Yule. Then they attacked the town, and met with
little resistance. King Magnus was seized on board his own
ship, and maimed. King Harald then took possession of the
whole kingdom, and the next spring he renewed the gift of
the Islands and the title of Earl to Rögnvald.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>KOL’S SCHEMES.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Kol</span> resolved to send men to the Orkneys to ask Earl Paul
to give up half the Islands which King Harald had given to
Rögnvald, and they should be friends and good kinsmen.
But if Earl Paul refused, the same men should go to Frákork
and Olvir Rosta, and offer them one-half of the land, jointly
with Earl Rögnvald, if they were willing to take it from Earl
Paul by force of arms. When they came to Earl Paul in
the Orkneys, and delivered the message, he replied: “I
understand this claim; it has been planned advisedly, and
with long forethought; they sought the help of the Kings
of Norway to obtain my possessions. Now, I will not repay
this perfidy by giving away my possessions to a man who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>not nearer to me than Rögnvald is, and refusing them to my
brother’s son or sister’s son. There is no need to talk any
more of this, for with the assistance of my friends and kinsmen
I shall defend the Orkneys as long as God grants me
life.”</p>
<p class='c008'>Then the messengers saw what would be the result of
their message to Earl Paul, and went away across the Pentland
Firth to Caithness, and south into the country to Frákork,
and delivered their message, to the effect that Kol and
Rögnvald offered her and Olvir half the Islands if they were
willing to conquer them from Earl Paul.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frákork replied: “It is true that Kol is a very clever
man, and it was wisely planned to seek assistance here, as
we have a great many relatives and connections. I have
now married Margaret, Hákon’s daughter, to Moddan, Earl of
Atjöklar (Athole), who is of the noblest family of all the
Scottish chiefs. His father, Malcolm, is the brother (uncle?)
of King Malcolm, the father of David, who is now King of
Scots. We have many and just claims on the Orkneys.
We ourselves have also some power. We are said also to
be rather far-seeing, and during hostilities all things do not
come on us unawares; yet we will be glad to enter into
alliance with Kol and his son for many reasons. Tell
them from me that I and Olvir shall bring an army to the
Orkneys against Earl Paul about the middle of the next
summer. Let Earl Rögnvald meet us then, and come to
a decisive battle with Earl Paul; and I will collect forces
together during the winter from my kinsmen, friends, and
connections in Scotland and the Sudreyar (Hebrides).”</p>

<p class='c008'>The messengers returned to Norway, and related how
matters stood. Next winter Earl Rögnvald prepared to go
west, and the chiefs Sölmund and Jón with him. They
went the next summer, and had a fine body of troops,
though not numerous, and five or six ships. They arrived
at Hjaltland (Shetland) about the middle of the summer,
but heard nothing of Frákork. Strong and contrary winds
sprung up, and they brought their ships to Alasund,<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c017'><sup>[324]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>went a-feasting over the country, for the Bœndr received
them well.</p>

<p class='c008'>But of Frákork it is to be told that in the spring she
went to the Sudreyar, where she and Olvir gathered troops
and ships together. They got twelve ships, all of them
small and somewhat badly manned; and about the middle
of the summer they directed their course to the Orkneys,
intending to meet Earl Rögnvald, according to their agreement.
The wind was rather unfavourable. Olvir Rosta
was the commander of these troops, and he was to obtain an
earldom in the Orkneys if they gained the victory. Frákork
was there also with many of her retainers.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE FIGHT BETWEEN EARL PAUL AND OLVIR ROSTA.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Paul</span> was then at a feast with Sigurd at Westness, in
Hrólfsey (Rousay), and when he heard that Earl Rögnvald
had arrived in Hjaltland, and at the same time that an army
which was going to attack him was gathering in the Sudreyar,
he sent word to Kugi, in Westrey, and Thorkel Flettir,
who were wise men, and many others of his chief men he
called together. At this meeting Earl Paul sought advice
from his friends, but they differed in their opinions. Some
wished him to share his possessions with one of the two
parties, so as not to have both as enemies. Others advised
him to go over to his friends in Ness (Caithness), and see
what assistance he could get there.</p>
<p class='c008'>Earl Paul replied, “I will not offer them my possessions
now, since I refused peremptorily when they asked civilly.
Besides, I think it would be unworthy of a chief to flee
from my lands without a trial of strength. My counsel is
to send men to-night to collect troops throughout all the
Islands. Let us then go to meet Earl Rögnvald, and have
matters decided between us before the Sudreymen come.”
Earl Paul’s plan was adopted.</p>

<p class='c008'>With Earl Paul there was a man by name Swein, called
Brióstreip (breast-rope), who was his henchman, and highly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>esteemed by him. In the summer he was always on viking-raids,
but in the winter [he stayed] with the Earl. Swein
was a man of large stature and great strength, swarthy and
ill-favoured. He was greatly skilled in ancient lore, and
had frequently been engaged in outsittings.<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c017'><sup>[325]</sup></a> His place
was in the forecastle of the Earl’s ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the night the following chiefs came to Earl Paul:—Eyvind,
Melbrigdi’s son, in a ship fully manned; Olaf, Rólf’s
son, from Gáreksey (Gairsay), had another; Thorkel Flettir
the third; Sigurd the fourth; and the Earl himself the fifth.
With these five vessels they went to Hrólfsey (Rousay),
and arrived there in the evening about sunset. Troops
gathered to him during the night, but more ships were not
to be had. The next day they were going to sail to Hjaltland
to meet Earl Rögnvald; but in the morning, shortly
after sunrise, some men came to Earl Paul, who said they
had seen longships coming from the Pentland Firth; whether
ten or twelve they did not know. The Earl and his men
were convinced that this was Frákork’s party, and the Earl
ordered his men to row against them as fast as possible.
Olaf and Sigurd advised them to go leisurely, saying that
their troops might arrive at any moment.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they were east of Tannskáruness (Tankerness), the
longships, twelve together, sailed to the west from Múli.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c017'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
The Earl and his men fastened their ships together; then
the Bondi, Erling from Tannskáruness, and his sons, came to
the Earl and offered him their assistance; and then their
ships were so crowded that they thought they could not use
more men. The Earl asked Erling and his men to bring
stones to them, until they were prevented by the fighting.
When they had prepared themselves, Olvir came up and
made the attack with a superior force, but his ships were
smaller. Olvir (himself) had a large ship, which he placed
beside the Earl’s ship, and there was the severest fighting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Olaf, Rólf’s son, attacked the smallest ships of Olvir, and
cleared three of them in a short time. Olvir attacked the
Earl’s ships so fiercely that all the forecastle men were
driven abaft the mast. Then Olvir urged his men strongly
to board, and jumped himself from the quarterdeck to the
forepart of the ship, and was the first to board.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein Brióstreip was the foremost of all the Earl’s men,
and fought bravely. When the Earl saw that Olvir had
boarded his ship, he urged his men forward, and jumped himself
from the quarterdeck to the forepart of the ship. When
Olvir perceived this, he grasped a spear, and hurled it at
the Earl, who received it with his shield, but fell down on
the deck. Then there was a great shout; but in the same
moment Swein Brióstreip seized a huge stone,<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c017'><sup>[327]</sup></a> and threw
it at Olvir. It hit him in the chest with such force that
he was thrown overboard, and sank; but his men were able
to drag him up into one of their ships, and it was not known
whether he was dead or alive. Then some cut the cables,
and wanted to flee. All Olvir’s men were also driven
down off the Earl’s ship, and began to withdraw. At that
moment Olvir recovered, and asked them not to flee; but
all pretended not to hear what he said. The Earl pursued
the fugitives along the east of Hrossey and Rögnvaldsey,
and into the Pentland Firth, where they parted. Then he
returned, and five of Olvir’s ships remained where they had
fought. The Earl took them, and manned them with his
troops. The battle took place on Friday, but in the night
the Earl had the ships made ready, and many troops and two
longships came to him, so that in the morning he had twelve
ships all well manned.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Saturday he sailed to Hjaltland, and took by surprise
those that had charge of Earl Rögnvald’s ships. He killed
the men, and seized the ships with all their contents. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the morning Earl Rögnvald had news of this, and his men
gathered together, and a great many of the Bœndr. Then
they went down to the beach, and challenged Earl Paul and
his men to come on shore and fight. Earl Paul did not
put much faith in the Hjaltlanders, and would not go on
shore; but he told them to take ships, and then they might
fight. Earl Rögnvald saw, however, that they could get no
ships in Hjaltland, such as would give them any chance, and
they parted thus as matters stood. Earl Paul and his men
went back to the Orkneys, but Earl Rögnvald and his men
remained in Hjaltland during the summer. In the autumn
they went back to Norway with some merchants, and it was
thought their expedition had come to a most ridiculous end.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Earl Rögnvald came to the east, he saw his
father Kol, who asked him whether he was dissatisfied with
his expedition. He replied that the result had brought
little honour to himself.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kol replied: “I do not think so; I think a great deal
has been done, since the Hjaltlanders are your friends, and
the journey was better than staying at home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rögnvald replied: “If you praise this journey, then you
are either more indifferent about my case than I thought,
or you see something in it which I do not perceive. I
should wish very much to have your counsels, and that you
would go with us yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kol replied: “I shall not do both—call everything
easy for you, and come nowhere near myself; but I think
I shall hold fast to my own plans, so that there is no prejudice
to your honour.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Rögnvald replied: “I will gladly follow your counsels.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kol replied: “First, I advise you to send word to King
Harald and other friends of yours, and ask them to give
you men and ships to go to the west in the spring; but
during the winter we ourselves will collect all the forces we
can, and then try a second time whether we can gain possession
of the Islands, or find our graves there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I have made up my mind,” said Earl Rögnvald, “not
to make another journey like that we made just now, and
I think that most of us who went are of the same mind.”</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL RÖGNVALD’S PLANS.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Paul</span> went back to the Orkneys, after having taken
the ships of Earl Rögnvald. He had gained a great victory,
and feasted all his friends and vassals.</p>
<p class='c008'>It was now resolved to make a beacon in Fridarey
(Fair Isle), which should be lighted if enemies were seen
coming from Hjaltland. Another beacon was made in
Rínarsey (North Ronaldsay), and others in some other islands
also, so that they might be seen all over the Islands.
Thorstein, the son of Hávard, Gunni’s son, was to have
charge of that on Rínarsey; his brother Magnus of the one
in Sandey; Kugi of that in Westrey; and Sigurd, at Westness,
of the one in Rólfsey. Olaf, Rólf’s son, went to Dungalsbæ,
in Caithness, and was to have the emoluments of
that place. His son Valthióf lived at that time in Straumsey
(Stroma).</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Paul gave presents to his men, and all promised
him their unfailing friendship. He had many men about
him in the autumn, until he heard that Rögnvald and his
men had left Hjaltland. Nothing happened in the Islands
until Yule. Earl Paul had a grand Yule feast, which he
prepared at his estate in Jórfiara (Orphir), and invited many
guests. Valthióf, Olaf’s son, from Straumsey (Stroma), was
invited. He went with his men in a ten-oared boat, and
they perished all of them in the West Firth on Yule Eve.
That was thought sad news, as Valthióf was a most accomplished
man. His father, Olaf, had a large party in Caithness.
There were his sons Swein and Gunni, and the sons
of Grím of Swiney,<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c017'><sup>[328]</sup></a> Asbiörn and Margad, brave-looking
fellows, who always followed Swein. Three nights before
Yule, Swein, Olaf’s son, Asbiörn, and Margad, had put out
to sea-fishing, and Asleif and her son, and Gunni, Olaf’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>son, had gone a short distance to visit their friends. The
night after that Olvir Rosta arrived at Dungalsbæ with the
party that had been out with him on a viking-raid during
the summer. He surprised Olaf in the house, and set it on
fire immediately. There he was burnt with five others, but
the rest were permitted to escape. Olvir and his men took
all the movable property, and then went away.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this Swein was called Asleif’s son. He came
home on Yule Eve, and went immediately out north, on
the Pentland Firth. At midnight they came to Grím, the
father of Asbiörn and Margad, in Swefney (Swona); he went
into the boat to them, and they brought Swein to Knarrarstadir
(Knarstane), in Skálpeid (Scapa). A man, by name
Arnkel, lived there. His sons were Hánef and Sigurd.
Grím and his sons returned, and Swein gave him a finger-ring
of gold. Hánef and Sigurd accompanied Swein to
Jórfiara (Orphir), where he was well received; and he was
conducted to his kinsman Eyvind Melbrigdi’s son. Eyvind
conducted him to Earl Paul, who received him well, and asked
his news. He told him of his father’s death, at which the
Earl was much grieved, and said it had in a great measure
happened through him. He invited Swein to stay with
him, and he accepted the invitation with thinks.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SWEIN SLAYS SWEIN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Then</span> they went to evensong. There was a large homestead
there (at Orphir); it stood on the hill-side, and there
was a height behind the houses. From the top of the hill
Aurridafiörd<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c017'><sup>[329]</sup></a> may be seen on the other side; in it lies
Damisey. In this island there was a castle; the keeper of
it was a man by name Blán, the son of Thorstein, at
Flydruness.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c017'><sup>[330]</sup></a> In Jórfiara there was a large drinking-hall;<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c017'><sup>[331]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the door was near the east gable on the southern wall, and
a magnificent church was in front of the door; and one had
to go down to the church from the hall. On entering the
hall one saw a large flat stone<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c017'><sup>[332]</sup></a> on the left hand; farther in
there were many large ale vessels; but opposite the outer
door was the stofa.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the guests came from evensong, they were placed
in their seats. The Earl had Swein, Asleif’s son, next to
him. On the other side, next to the Earl, was Swein
Brióstreip, and then Jón his kinsman. When the tables
were removed, there came in men with the tidings of
Valthióf’s drowning. This the Earl considered sad news.
He said that no one should tell it to Swein while the
Yule feast lasted, adding that he had cares enow already.
In the evening, when they had finished drinking, the
Earl went to bed, and so did most of his guests. Swein
Brióstreip went out and sat out all night, as was his
wont. In the night (at midnight?) the guests arose
and heard mass, and after high mass they sat down to the
table. Eyvind Melbrigdi’s son, shared the management of
the feast with the Earl, and did not sit down to the table.
Table-boys and candle-boys were standing before the Earl’s
table,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c017'><sup>[333]</sup></a> but Eyvind handed drinking-cups to each of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Sweins. Swein Brióstreip thought Eyvind poured more
into his cup than Swein, Asleif’s son’s, and that he took
the cup away from the latter before he had emptied it,
so he called Swein, Asleif’s son, a sluggard at his drink.
There had long been a coldness between Swein Brióstreip
and Olaf, Hrólf’s son, and also between him and Swein,
Asleif’s son, since he grew up. When they had been drinking
for a while, the guests went to nones’ service. When
they came in again, memorial toasts<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c017'><sup>[334]</sup></a> were proposed, and
they drank out of horns. Then Swein Brióstreip wished
to exchange horns with his namesake, saying his was a small
one. Eyvind, however, put a big horn into Swein Asleif’s
son’s hand, and this he offered to his namesake. Then
Swein Brióstreip became angry, and was overheard by the
Earl and some of the men muttering to himself, “Swein
will be the death of Swein, and Swein shall be the death
of Swein.” But nothing was said about it. The drinking
went on until evensong; and when the Earl went out,
Swein, Asleif’s son, walked before him; but Swein Brióstreip
remained behind drinking. When they came out to
the ale-room, Eyvind followed them, and craved a word
alone with Swein, Asleif’s son.</p>

<p class='c008'>He said, “Did you not hear what your namesake said
when you offered him the horn?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Eyvind repeated his words, and said that it was
surely the devil that had spoken through his mouth in the
night. “He intends to kill you,” he added, “but you
should forestall him, and slay him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Eyvind put an axe into his hand, and told him to stand
in the shadow beside the flat stone; he should strike him in
front if Jón preceded him; but from behind if Jón followed
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl went to the church, and no one took heed of
Eyvind and Swein; but when Swein Brióstreip and Jón
walked out shortly after, the latter had a sword in his hand,
as was his habit, though the others were unarmed.  Jón
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>walked in front. Some light came through the outer door,
but outside the sky was cloudy. When Swein Brióstreip
came into the doorway, Swein, Asleif’s son, struck him on
the forehead, so that he stumbled, but did not fall; and
when he regained his footing, he saw a man in the door,
and thought it was he who had wounded him. Then he
drew his sword, and struck at his head, splitting it down to
the shoulders. This, however, was Jón, his kinsman, and
they fell there both. Eyvind came up at the same moment,
and led Swein, Asleif’s son, into the stofa, opposite the
door, and he was dragged out through a window. There
Magnus, Eyvind’s son, had a horse ready for him, and
accompanied him away behind the house, and into Aurrida
Firth. There he took a boat, and brought Swein to the
castle in Damisey; and the next morning Blán accompanied
him to Bishop William, in Egilsey. When they arrived
there the Bishop was at mass, and after the mass Swein
was conducted to him secretly. Swein told the Bishop the
news—the death of his father and brother Valthióf, and the
slaughter of Swein and Jón; then he besought the Bishop’s
assistance. The Bishop thanked him for the slaughter of
Swein Brióstreip, and said it was a good riddance.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c017'><sup>[335]</sup></a> He
kept Swein, Asleif’s son, during the Yule-tide, and after
that he sent him to a man called Höldbodi, Hundi’s son, in
Tyrvist (Tiree), in the Sudreyar (Hebrides). Höldbodi was
a great chief, and received Swein very well, and there he
spent the winter highly esteemed of all the people.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL PAUL.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>A short</span> time after the slaughters had been committed in
Jórfiara, the men ran from the church, and carried Swein
into the house, for he was not yet dead, but insensible, and
he died during the night. The Earl commanded every one
to take his seat, as he wished to know for certain who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>committed the manslaughters. Then Swein, Asleif’s son, was
missed, and it was thought clear that he had done the deed.</p>
<p class='c008'>Then Eyvind came and said that it was plainly seen that
Swein Brióstreip must have killed Jón.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said that no one should touch a hair of Swein
Asleif’s son’s head, as this had not been done without provocation.
“But if he avoids meeting with me,” he said, “he
will harm himself by so doing.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It was thought most probable that Swein had gone to
Hákon Karl in Papuli,<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c017'><sup>[336]</sup></a> the brother of Earl Magnus the holy.
He was a great chief, a quiet man and moderate. The Earl
did not hear of Swein that winter, and then he outlawed
him. In the spring the Earl visited many of the northern
islands, to collect his land-dues. He made great friends of
the chiefs, and bestowed presents with both hands. The
Earl visited Straumsey (Stroma), and gave Thorkel Flettir
the farm which Valthióf had, till such time as he should know
where Swein was.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorkel said: “Here the saying does not prove true,
that ‘the King has many ears.’ Although you are an Earl,
I think it strange that you have not heard of Swein, for I
knew immediately that Bishop William had sent him to
Höldbodi, Hundi’s son, in the Sudreyar, and there he has
been all winter.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “What shall I do with a Bishop who
has acted thus?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorkel replied: “The Bishop should not be blamed for
this in critical times like these; and you will need all your
friends if Rögnvald and his men come from the east.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said that was true.</p>

<p class='c008'>From Straumsey he went to Rínarsey, and received an entertainment
from Ragna and her son Thorstein. Ragna was
a wise woman. They (she and her son) had another farm in
Papey. The Earl spent three nights there, as he was prevented
by weather from going to Kugi, in Westrey. The
Earl and Ragna spoke of many things.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>She said to him: “There was no great loss in Swein
Brióstreip, although he was a brave warrior, for he brought
on you the hatred of many. I should therefore advise you,
in presence of the difficulties that face you, to make as many
friends as possible, and be slow to resent offences. I could
wish that you would not attach blame to Bishop William
and other kinsmen of Swein, Asleif’s son, but rather take the
Bishop into favour, and send word to the Sudreyar after Swein
to pardon him and restore him his possessions, in order that
he may be to you such as his father was. It has long been
the custom of the noblest men to do a great deal for their
friends, and thus to secure support and popularity.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “You are a wise woman, Ragna, but
you have not yet been made Earl of the Orkneys, and you
shall not rule the land here. Is it come to this, that I must
give Swein money in order to be reconciled to him, thinking
that it would be to my advantage?” Then he became wroth,
and continued: “Let God decide between me and my kinsman
Rögnvald, and may He let it happen to each of us
according to his deeds. If I have offended against Rögnvald,
I now make offer of reparation; but if he will invade my
dominions, I will think him my greatest friend who assists
me to defend them. I have never seen Rögnvald; and, so
far from having ever offended him with my knowledge, it is
known that I had no part in what my kinsmen did.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Many replied that to try to deprive him of his possessions
by force of arms would be a most unprovoked assault;
and no one spoke against this.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the spring advanced, Earl Paul had beacons kept
up in Fridarey (Fair Isle) and Rínarsey (North Ronaldsay),
and almost all the Islands, so that each could be seen from
the other. A man named Dagfinn, Hlödver’s son, an active
fellow who had a farm in Fridarey, was to keep that beacon,
and light it if an army were seen coming from Hjaltland.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald spent the winter at home at Agdir (in
Norway), where he and his father had farms, and sent messages
to his kinsmen and friends. Some of them he visited
himself, and asked them to assist him with troops and ships
to go to the west, and most of them were willing to help him
in his need.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>During the month of Gói,<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c017'><sup>[337]</sup></a> Kol sent away two transport
vessels; one west to England to buy provisions and
arms. Sölmund took the other south to Denmark, to buy
such things as Kol told him, because he had all the management
of their equipment. It was intended that these vessels
should return about Easter, and they had arranged to start
in the week after Easter. Kol and Rögnvald had one war-ship
each, and Sölmund a third; they had also a transport
ship with provisions. When they came to Biörgvin, King
Harald was there, and he gave Rögnvald a war-ship fully
manned. Jón Fót (leg) had a war-ship also. Aslák, the
son of Erlend, from Hernur, and the daughter’s son of Steigar
Thórir, had the sixth; he had also a barge with provisions.
Thus they had six large ships, five boats, and three transports.
When they were waiting for fair wind at Hernur, a
ship came from the west, and they asked for news from the
Orkneys, and also what preparations Earl Paul would have
if Earl Rögnvald came to the west.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>KOL’S COUNSELS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>While</span> they were lying at Hernur, Earl Rögnvald called
together a meeting of his men, and spoke of Earl Paul’s preparations,
and also of the great enmity the Orkneymen
showed against himself, since they were going to prevent him
taking possession of his patrimonial inheritance, which had
been justly given him by the Kings of Norway. He made
a long and eloquent speech, the conclusion of which was that
he intended to go to the Orkneys and gain them or die there.
His speech was approved of by all, and every one promised
him faithful support.</p>
<p class='c008'>Then Kol arose and said: “We have heard from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Orkneys that all the islanders will rise with Earl Paul
against you to keep you out of your inheritance. They are
slow to lay aside the enmity which they have conceived
against you, kinsman. Now it is my counsel to seek for
help where it is likely to be had effectually, and to pray
that he may permit you to enjoy these possessions, to whom
they rightly belong—namely, the Holy Saint Magnus, your
mother’s brother. It is my wish that you should make a
vow to him, that he may grant you your patrimony and his
inheritance. You should promise one thing—that if you
obtain those dominions you will build a stone minster at
Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall) in the Orkneys, more magnificent than
any other in these lands, dedicating it to your kinsman, Earl
Magnus the Holy, endowing it with money, so that it may
be fitly established, and that his relics and the Bishop’s see
may be brought there.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Every one thought this good advice, and the vow was
made and confirmed. Then they stood out to sea, and had
a fair wind. They landed in Hjaltland, and the inhabitants
there, as well as the Norwegians, were glad to see each other.
The Hjaltlanders were able to tell them much from the
Orkneys, and there they stayed for some time.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF KOL AND UNI.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Uni</span>, who has been mentioned before, and who was an accomplice
in the slaughter of Brynjúlf, was now advanced in years.</p>
<p class='c008'>Once Kol said to him: “What plan would you propose,
Uni, in order to get the beacon in Fridarey discontinued,
or how would you manage to prevent it from being lighted
a second time? I put this question to you, because I know
you are more ready-witted than most others here present,
although here are men of more distinction.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Uni replied: “I am not a man of invention, and I do
not wish the expedition to be made according to my plans;
I would rather choose to come afterwards, for then I should
follow my own devices.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Shortly after, Kol had many small boats made ready, and
directed their course to the Orkneys. No chiefs took part
in this expedition except Kol. When they had gone so far
that they thought they could be seen from Fridarey, Kol
had the sails spread on all the boats, but ordered his men to
row backwards, in order that their speed might be as slow as
possible, although the wind was right astern. The sails were
at first hauled to the middle of the masts only, but afterwards
higher, as if they were coming nearer to the island.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kol said: “These manœuvres will be seen from Fridarey
as if the boats were approaching nearer. They will then
perhaps light the beacon, but they will go themselves to Earl
Paul to tell him the news.”</p>

<p class='c008'>So when the beacon in Fridarey was seen, Thorstein,
Ragna’s son, lighted the beacon in Rínarsey; then the
beacons were lighted one after another in all the Islands, and
all the Bœndr went to the Earl, and there was a great gathering
of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Kol saw the beacon burning, he ordered his men
to turn back, saying that this would now cause dissensions
among their enemies. This done, Kol went back to Hjaltland,
and said to Uni that he should now carry out his scheme.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uni took with him three Hjaltlanders, and they took a
six-oared boat, some provisions, and fishing tackle. They
went to Fridarey. Uni said he was a Norwegian, but had
been married in Hjaltland, and had sons there. He further
said that he had been robbed by Earl Rögnvald’s men, and
spoke very ill of them. He took a house there, but his sons
went out fishing, and he stayed at home himself and took
care of the fish they caught. He entered into conversation
with the men of the island, and became familiar with them,
and was well liked.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE ORKNEYMEN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Dagfinn had lighted the beacon, he went to
Paul, as has been mentioned before. All the Earl’s leading
men came to him also. A watch was kept for Rögnvald’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>movements, and it was thought strange that he nowhere
appeared. Still the troops were kept together for three
days. Then the Islanders began to murmur, saying that it
was great foolishness to light beacons when fishermen were
seen in their boats.</p>
<p class='c008'>Thorstein, Ragna’s son, was blamed for having lighted
the beacon in Rínarsey. He replied that he could do
nothing but light his beacon when he saw the blaze in
Fridarey, and said that this had all happened through
Dagfinn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dagfinn replied: “People come more frequently to harm
through you when you cannot blame me for it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorstein told him to be silent, and leapt up with an
axe and dealt him a heavy blow. Then each man seized
his weapons, and there was a fray. This was in Hrossey, not
far from Kirkiuvag. Sigurd from Westness, and his son
Hákon Kló, and Brynjúlf, took part with Hlödver, Dagfinn’s
father, but Thorstein was aided by his kinsmen. Then the
Earl was informed of what was going on, and it was a long
time until he could part them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kugi of Westrey made a long speech, and said: “Do not
disgrace the Earl by fighting among yourselves. Ere long
you will need all your men; let us take care then not to be
disabled or at enmity among ourselves. This has probably
happened according to the designs of our enemies, and has
been a device of theirs to destroy the beacons in this way.
Now they may be expected every day, and let us make our
plans accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Dagfinn said: “No one has had any evil intention in
this, but we have acted with more thoughtlessness than we
ought to have done.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Kugi guessed the whole truth, and spoke many wise
words about it. At last they both agreed that the Earl
should judge between them; and it was resolved to disperse
the gathering, and the people went home.</p>

<p class='c008'>A man by name Eirik was now appointed to take charge
of the beacon in Fridarey. When Uni had stopped there a
short time, he came to Eirik, and said: “Would you like me
to take care of the beacon; I have nothing else to do, and
can give it my undivided attention.” Eirik accepted his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>offer, and when no one was near Uni poured water over it,
and made it so wet that it could not be lighted.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE BEACONS OF THE ORKNEYS DESTROYED.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Rögnvald</span> and his men said they would wait until the
tidal currents were met by an east wind, for then it is hardly
possible to go from Westrey to Hrossey, but with east wind
one can sail from Hjaltland to Westrey. For this Rögnvald
and his men waited, and came one Friday evening to Höfn,<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c017'><sup>[338]</sup></a>
in Westrey, to Helgi, who dwelt there.</p>

<p class='c008'>No beacons could be lighted, for when the sails were
seen from Fridarey, Eirik prepared to go to Earl Paul, and
sent a man to Uni to light the beacon, but when he came
there Uni was away. When the man tried to light the
beacon himself, it was so wet that it would not burn. When
Eirik heard this, he knew what was the matter, and went to
Earl Paul and told him.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Earl Rögnvald had arrived in Westrey, the islanders
ran together. Helgi and Kugi put themselves at their head,
and their first plan was to try to make peace with the Earl;
and their dealings ended in such a way that the Westreymen
submitted to Earl Rögnvald, and swore him oaths of fealty.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>ROGNVALD RULES THE ORKNEYS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>On</span> Sunday Earl Rögnvald had mass celebrated there in the
village.<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c017'><sup>[339]</sup></a> As they were standing outside the church, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>saw sixteen men approaching unarmed, and with their hair
close cut. The Earl’s men thought their dress singular, and
spoke among themselves of who they might be. Then the
Earl made a ditty:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sixteen have I seen together,</div>
      <div class='line'>With a small tuft on their foreheads;</div>
      <div class='line'>Surely these are women coming,</div>
      <div class='line'>All without their golden trinkets.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now may we of this bear witness.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the west here all the maidens</div>
      <div class='line'>Wear their hair short—that isle Elon<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c017'><sup>[340]</sup></a></div>
      <div class='line'>Lies out in the stormy ocean.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>After Sunday, Earl Rögnvald’s men visited the neighbouring
districts, and all the people gave in their submission
to the Earl. One night in Westrey the Earl’s men became
aware that the islanders were holding a secret meeting to
devise some treachery against Earl Rögnvald. When the
Earl heard of it, he rose and went to the place of meeting.
When he came there, his men had beaten many of the
islanders, and had taken Farmer Kugi and put him in fetters,
saying that he was the author of all these proceedings.
Kugi pled his cause eloquently, and many put in a word for
him, and protested his innocence with him. Then the Earl
sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>I can see the crooked irons</div>

      <div class='line'>Stray thou canst not in thy fetters,</div>
      <div class='line'>Old man! fond of making night trips;</div>
      <div class='line'>Now you must not hold night meetings,</div>
      <div class='line'>And must keep the peace established;</div>
      <div class='line'>Kugi! all your tricks are hinder’d,</div>
      <div class='line'>And your oaths you must keep sacred.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Earl pardoned them all, and they renewed their compact.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL ROGNVALD AND PAUL.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> Earl Rögnvald’s arrival in the Orkneys, and when
many had submitted to him, Earl Paul held a meeting in
Hrossey with his men for consultation. The Earl asked
their opinion of what was to be done in these difficulties.
There were considerable differences of opinion. Some advised
Earl Paul to share his dominions with Earl Rögnvald. But
most of the more powerful men and Bœndr wished to buy
Rögnvald away with money, and offered their means for that
purpose. Others were for fighting, as they said that this had
been the successful way before.</p>
<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald had spies at the meeting, and when they
came to him, the Earl asked a certain skald, who had been
there, for news. He sang:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Of our foes I gain’d this knowledge</div>
      <div class='line'>That o’er secrets they are brooding.</div>
      <div class='line'>From the meeting of the Bœndr</div>
      <div class='line'>Has the great chief heard the tidings</div>
      <div class='line'>That among the powerful feeders</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the wolves, the wish prevails that</div>
      <div class='line'>All your ships should leave the islands</div>
      <div class='line'>And that Paul should rule the land here.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then Earl Rögnvald sent men to see the Bishop, and
asked for his intervention. He also sent for Thorstein,
Ragna’s son, and Thorstein, Hávard’s son, in Sandey, and requested
them to try to make peace between him and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>kinsman. The Bishop procured a fortnight’s truce, in order
that they might endeavour to establish a more lasting peace.
Then the islands were allocated that should maintain each
of them in the meantime.<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c017'><sup>[341]</sup></a> Earl Rögnvald went to Hrossey
(Mainland), and Earl Paul to Hrólfsey (Rousay).</p>

<p class='c008'>At this time it happened that the kinsmen Swein,
Asleif’s son, Jón Væng of Uppland in Háey, and Rikgard
of Brekkur in Stiórnsey (Stronsay), attacked Thorkel Flettir
on the estate which had belonged to Valthióf, and burnt
him in the house, with nine others. After that they went
to Earl Rögnvald, and told him that they would go to Earl
Paul with the whole body of their kinsmen, if he would not
receive them; but he did not turn them away.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as Haflidi, Thorkel’s son, heard of his father’s
burning, he went to Earl Paul, who received him well.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this Jón and his men bound themselves to serve
Earl Rögnvald, who had now many followers in the Islands,
and had become popular. Earl Rögnvald gave leave to
Jón, Sölmund, and Aslák, and many others of his partizans,
to go home, but they said they preferred to wait until matters
should be definitely settled. Earl Rögnvald replied:
“If it is the will of God that I should gain possession of
the Orkneys, I think He and the Holy Earl Magnus, my
kinsman, will give me strength to hold them, even if you
go home to your estates.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they went home to Norway.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SWEIN TAKES EARL PAUL CAPTIVE.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Early</span> in the spring, Swein, Asleif’s son, left the Sudreyar
(Hebrides), and went to Scotland to see his friends. He
stayed a long time at Atjöklar (Athole) with Earl Maddad
and Margaret, Hákon’s daughter, and had many secret consultations
with them. Swein heard that there were disturbances
in the Orkneys, and became desirous of going there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>to see his kinsmen. He went first to Thórsey (Thurso), in
Caithness, accompanied by a nobleman by name Liótólf.
Swein had stayed with him a long time in the spring. They
came to Earl Ottar, at Thórsey, the brother of Frákork.
Liótólf tried to make them compose the matters that had
been done by Frákork’s orders, and Earl Ottar made compensation
for his part. He promised his friendship to
Swein, and he promised to Ottar, in return, to help Erlend,
the son of Harald Sléttmáli (smooth-talker), to obtain his
patrimony in the Orkneys when he should wish to claim it.</p>
<p class='c008'>Swein changed ships there, and took a barge manned
by thirty men. He crossed the Pentland Firth with a north-westerly
wind, and so along the west side of Hrossey, on to
Efjusund,<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c017'><sup>[342]</sup></a> and along the sound to Hrólfsey (Rousay). At
one end of the island there is a large headland and a vast
heap of stones beneath it. Otters often resorted to this
stone-heap. As they were rowing along the sound, Swein
said, “There are men on the headland, let us land and ask
them for news; let us change our dress, untie our hammocks,<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c017'><sup>[343]</sup></a>
and twenty of us lie down there, and ten keep on
rowing: let us go leisurely.” When they came near the
headland the men in the island called to them to row to
Westness, and bring Earl Paul what was in their vessel,
thinking they were speaking to merchants. Earl Paul had
spent the night at a feast with Sigurd, at Westness. He had
been early up in the morning, and twenty men had gone
south on the island to catch otters, which were in the
stone-heap beneath the headland. They were going home
to get a morning draught. The men in the barge rowed
near the land; they asked the men on shore about all the
news, and were asked what news they brought, and whence
they came. Swein’s men also asked where the Earl was, and
the others said he was on the stone-heap there. This was
heard by Swein and those that lay hid with him in the skin-bags.
Swein told them to row to land, where they could not
be seen from the headland. Then he told his men to get
their weapons, and slay the Earl’s men wherever they found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>them, and so they did. Swein’s party killed nineteen men,
and lost six. They seized Earl Paul with violence, and
brought him on board their ship, and stood out to sea,
returning by the same way, by the west side of Hrólfsey,
and through the channel between Háey and Grimsey, and
then by the east of Svelgr,<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c017'><sup>[344]</sup></a> thence to Breidafiord (the Moray
Firth), until they came to Ekkialsbakki.<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c017'><sup>[345]</sup></a> There he left his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>ship with twenty men, and continued his journey until he
came to Earl Maddad<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c017'><sup>[346]</sup></a> and Margaret, Earl Paul’s sister, at
Atjöklar (Athole). There they were well received. Earl
Maddad placed Earl Paul in his high seat, and when they
were seated, Margaret entered with a long train of ladies, and
advanced to her brother. Then men were procured to
amuse them; but Earl Paul was moody, and it was no
wonder, for he had many cares.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not recorded what passed between Earl Paul and
Swein while they were on the journey together. Earl
Maddad, Margaret, and Swein, had a consultation together;
but in the evening, when the drinking was finished, Swein’s
followers were conducted to a sleeping-room by themselves,
and the key turned upon them. This was done every evening
while they were there.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON’S, RETURN TO THE ORKNEYS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>One</span> day Margaret announced that Swein, Asleif’s son, should
go to the Orkneys to see Earl Rögnvald, and ask him whom
he preferred to share in the dominion of the Orkneys with
him—Earl Paul, or Harald, the son of (her husband) Maddad,
who was then three winters old.</p>
<p class='c008'>When Earl Paul heard this, he said: “So far as my
mind is concerned, I will say that I have left my dominions
in such a way as has never been heard of before, I think;
and I shall never return to the Orkneys any more. I see
that this must be God’s vengeance for the theft which I
and my kinsmen committed. But if God thinks the dominion
mine, then will I give it to Harald, if he may enjoy it;
but I wish some money given to me, so that I may establish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>myself in some monastery, and you can take care that
I do not escape. And you, Swein, shall go out to the
Orkneys, and say that I have been blinded, or still more
mutilated, because my friends will fetch me if I am an
unmaimed man. In that case I may not be able to refuse
to return to my dominions with them, for I suspect that
they will consider our parting a greater loss than it is.”</p>

<p class='c008'>What more the Earl said has not been placed on
record.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Swein, Asleif’s son, went to the Orkneys, and
Earl Paul remained behind in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is how Swein related these matters. But some
men tell the story in a way by no means so creditable (to
those concerned)—namely, that Margaret induced Swein,
Asleif’s son, to blind her brother Earl Paul, then threw him
into a dungeon, and subsequently induced another man to
put him to death. We do not know which of these two
statements is the more correct; but it is well known that
Earl Paul came never again to the Orkneys, and that he had
no dominions in Scotland.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL ROGNVALD AND SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>It</span> happened at Westness, when the Earl did not come home,
that Sigurd sent men to search for him. When they came
to the stone-heap they saw the slain, and then they thought
the Earl had been killed. They went home and told the
news. Sigurd went immediately to examine the bodies,
and they recognised nineteen as the Earl’s men; but six
they did not know. Then Sigurd sent men to Egilsey, to
the Bishop, to tell him the news. He went immediately to
Sigurd. When they were talking about what had happened,
Sigurd hinted that it had been done at the instigation of
Earl Rögnvald; but the Bishop replied that it would be
proved that Earl Rögnvald had not acted treacherously
towards his kinsman Earl Paul. “It is my opinion,” he
said, “that some others have committed this crime.”</p>
<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Borgar, the son of Játvör, Erlend’s daughter, who lived
at Geitaberg,<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c017'><sup>[347]</sup></a> had seen the barge coming from the south,
and returning. When this was heard, it was believed to
have been done at the instigation of Frákork and Olvir.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the news spread in the Islands that Earl Paul
had disappeared, and no one knew what had become of him,
the Islanders had a consultation, and most of them went to
Earl Rögnvald, and swore fealty to him; but Sigurd, of
Westness, and his sons, Brynjúlf and Hákon Kló, said they
would not swear oaths of fealty to any man while they did
not know anything of Earl Paul, or whether he might he
expected to return or not. There were others also who
refused to swear oaths to Earl Rögnvald. Others again fixed
an hour or a day when they would become Earl Rögnvald’s
men, if Earl Paul had not then been heard of. But when
Earl Rögnvald saw that he had to do with many powerful
men, he did not refuse peremptorily anything which the
people asked; and, as the time passed, he had frequent
meetings with the inhabitants, and at each of them some
submitted to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>One day it happened in Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall) when
Earl Rögnvald was holding a Thing meeting with the Bœndr,
that nine armed men were seen walking from Skálpeid
(Scapa) to the meeting. When they came near, Swein,
Asleif’s son, was recognised, and all were curious to know
what news he had to tell. He had come in a ship to Skálpeid,
and left it there, while he and his men walked to
Kirkiuvag. When Swein came to the meeting, his kinsmen
and friends turned to him, and asked him for news, but
he did not say much. Swein sent for the Bishop, who
welcomed him heartily, because they had long been friends.
They went aside to talk, and Swein told the Bishop the
whole truth about what he had done, and asked for his
advice in these difficult circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bishop said: “Those are weighty tidings you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>brought, Swein, and we shall probably not be by ourselves
sufficient in this matter. I wish you to wait here for me;
but I shall plead your cause before the people and Earl
Rögnvald.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then the Bishop went to the meeting, and asked for
silence. When silence was obtained, the Bishop pleaded
Swein’s cause, explaining for what reason he had left the
Orkneys, and what penalties Earl Paul had inflicted on him
for the slaying of Swein Brióstreip, a most wicked man.
The Bishop concluded by asking Earl Rögnvald and all the
people to grant security to Swein.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald replied: “For my part, I promise Swein
three nights’ security; but I think I can see from your
countenance, Sir Bishop, that you and Swein know some
great news which you have not yet made known. I wish
you to take Swein into your keeping, and to be responsible
for him, and I will speak to him to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I will,” said the Bishop; “and he will be very glad to
speak to you as soon as possible; for he wishes to become
your man, if you are willing to receive him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “I do not think my friends are too
many in these lands, yet I shall have some farther talk
before I consent to this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then these four—Earl Rögnvald, his father Kol, the
Bishop, and Swein, Asleif’s son—had a private interview.
Swein repeated everything, good and bad, that had happened
between him and Earl Paul, and they came to the
conclusion to send away the bulk of the people at the meeting.
The Earl arose next morning and gave the people
permission to go home; but when the multitude had gone
away, he called together all those that remained, and made
them all renew their promise of security to Swein, while he
told the news.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the morning, Magnus<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c017'><sup>[348]</sup></a> Karl, the brother of the Holy
Earl Magnus, was persuaded to tell Sigurd of Westness and
his sons of Earl Paul’s abduction, that he was not to be
expected back to his dominions, and that he had been
maimed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sigurd said: “Great news do I think this, about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>carrying away of the Earl; yet to me the saddest of all is
that he should have been maimed, for he would not be anywhere
where I would not go to him.” Afterwards he told
his friends that Hákon would not have left him unharmed,
if he had had a sufficient force with him when he told him
these tidings, so greatly was he moved by them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the news became generally known, all the Orkneymen
submitted to Earl Rögnvald, and he became the sole
ruler of Earl Paul’s dominions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not long after this the foundations of St. Magnus’ Church<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c017'><sup>[349]</sup></a>
were marked out, and craftsmen procured, so that more was
done during that year than in the ensuing four or five.
Kol took great interest in the erection of the building, and
had the principal oversight of the whole; but as it proceeded,
it became very expensive to the Earl, and his means
were nearly exhausted. Then he consulted his father, and
he advised him to pass a law declaring that the Earls should
be considered to have inherited all the odal possessions
from the owners, but that they were to be redeemable by the
heirs.<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c017'><sup>[350]</sup></a> This was considered a great hardship. Then Earl
Rögnvald called a Thing meeting, and proposed to the Bœndr
that they should purchase the odal possessions, so that it
would not be necessary to redeem them afterwards, and an
agreement was made with which all parties were satisfied.
It was to this effect, that they should pay the Earl one
mark (eight oz. of silver) for each plough’s land all over the
Islands. From that time there was no want of money to
build the church; and it was made a magnificent structure.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>BISHOP JÓN ARRIVES FROM SCOTLAND.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Earl Rögnvald had ruled the Orkneys two winters he
had a Yule-feast at his estate called Knarrarstadir.<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c017'><sup>[351]</sup></a> The
sixth day of Yule a ship was seen crossing the Pentland
Firth from the south. It was a fine day, and the Earl was
outside the house, with many men, looking at the ship.
There was also a man named Hrólf, the Earl’s court priest.
When the strangers landed, they left the ship, and the Earl’s
men calculated their number to be fifteen or sixteen.<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c017'><sup>[352]</sup></a> In
front of them walked a man in a blue cloak, with his hair
tucked up under the cap; the lower part of the chin was
shaved,<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c017'><sup>[353]</sup></a> but the lips unshaved, and the long beard was
hanging down (from them). They thought this man somewhat
strange, but Hrólf said it was Bishop Jón from Atjöklar
(Athole), in Scotland. Then the Earl went to meet
them, and gave the Bishop a gracious welcome. He placed
him in his high seat, but served at the table himself like a
waiter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Early next morning the Bishop held a service, and went
to Egilsey to see Bishop William. This was the tenth
day of Yule. Then both the Bishops went with a noble
suite to visit Earl Rögnvald, and told him their business,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>explaining the agreement between Swein, Asleif’s son, and
Earl Maddad—namely, that their son Harald should bear the
title of Earl, and have half the Orkneys jointly with Earl
Rögnvald, but Earl Rögnvald should have the government in
his hands, even when Harald grew up; and if a difference
arose between them, Earl Rögnvald should have his own way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein was present, and confirmed the Bishop’s statement.
It was resolved to hold a meeting during Lent in
Caithness, and there they agreed upon the terms above
mentioned, and their agreement was confirmed by the oaths
of the best men of the Orkneys and Scotland. Then Harald,
Maddad’s son, went to the Orkneys with Earl Rögnvald, and
was invested with the title of Earl.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harald was accompanied to the islands by Thorbiörn
Klerk, the son of Thorstein Höld, and Gudrún, the daughter
of Frákork. He was a wise and a great man. He was
foster-father to Harald at that time, and had great influence
with him. Thorbiörn married in the Orkneys Ingirid,
Olaf’s daughter, sister to Swein, Asleif’s son. He was
sometimes in the Orkneys, and sometimes in Scotland. He
was a most valiant man, but overbearing in most things.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein, Asleif’s son, took possession of all the estates
that belonged to his father Olaf and his brother Valthióf;
he became a great chief, and had always many men with
him. He was a wise man, and far-seeing in many things;
but overbearing and rash. No two men in the west were
considered at that time greater than the brothers-in-law
Swein and Thorbiörn, and there was a warm friendship
between them.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE BURNING OF FRAKORK.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>On</span> one occasion Swein, Asleif’s son, asked Earl Rögnvald to
give him troops and ships to take vengeance on Olvir and
Frákork for the burning of his father Olaf.</p>
<p class='c008'>The Earl said: “Do you not think, Swein, that Olvir
and that old hag Frákork, who is good for nothing, will
scarcely be able to do us any harm now?”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Swein replied: “They will always be mischievous
while they live; and I expected something else when I
did great things for you, than that you would refuse me
this.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “What will you be satisfied with?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein said: “Two ships well equipped.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said he should have what he wished.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he made preparations for going. When he was
ready he sailed south to Borgarfiord,<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c017'><sup>[354]</sup></a> and had a northwest
wind to Dúfeyrar,<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c017'><sup>[355]</sup></a> which is a trading-place in Scotland.
From there he passed Moray to Ekkialsbakki,<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c017'><sup>[356]</sup></a> and
from there he went to Earl Maddad at Atjöklar (Athole).
He gave Swein guides who knew the way across mountains
and forests wherever Swein wished to go; and he went
through the interior of the country, over mountains and
through woods, away from all habitations, and came down in
Hjálmundal,<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c017'><sup>[357]</sup></a> near the middle of Sutherland. Olvir and
Frákork had had spies wherever they thought they might
expect enemies from the Orkneys, but this way they did not
expect any. They did not, therefore, perceive the enemy
till Swein and his men were in a certain slope behind the
house. Olvir Rosta met them there with sixty men, and
the fight began immediately. There was little resistance on
the part of Olvir’s men, and they retreated towards the houses,
because they could not reach the wood. A great many were
killed, and Olvir ran to Hjálmundal’s river, and then up on
the mountains. After that he went to Scotland’s Firth (on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the west coast), and from there to the Sudreyar (Hebrides),
and he is not mentioned further in this Saga.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Olvir escaped, Swein and his men approached the
houses, and plundered everything. Then they burnt the
houses, with all the inmates, and there Frákork perished.
Swein and his men committed many ravages in Sutherland
before they went to their ships. After that they were out
on raids during the summer, and ravaged in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the autumn Swein came to Earl Rögnvald in the
Orkneys, and was well received. Then he crossed over to
Ness (Caithness), and spent the winter in Dungalsbæ. At
this time Swein received a message from Höldbodi, in the
Sudreyar, that he should come and help him, because Höld
from Bretland had been there, driven him from his estates,
and taken much booty. The messenger was named Hródbjart
(Robert), of English descent. When Swein received
the message, he quickly left for the Orkneys, and called on
Earl Rögnvald, and requested him to give him troops and
ships. The Earl asked Swein what he was going to do then.
He said that he had received a message from a man whom he
ought least of all to refuse, and who had proved his best friend
in his greatest need, and when most others were his enemies.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said: “It is well if you part good friends, but
most of those Sudreyarmen are treacherous. You must,
however, act a manly part, and I will give you two ships
fully manned.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein was well pleased with this, and went to the Sudreyar,
but did not find Höldbodi till he came to the Isle of
Man, because the latter had fled thither. When Swein
came to the Isle of Man, Höldbodi was very glad to see him.
The British Höld had plundered and killed men, to a large
extent in the Isle of Man as well as in the Sudreyar. He
had killed a nobleman named Andrew, who left a widow by
name Ingirid, and a son by name Sigurd. Ingirid was
wealthy, and had large estates. Höldbodi advised Swein to
woo her; and when he proposed marriage, she made it a
condition of her acceptance that he should avenge her late
husband Andrew.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein replied: “I may inflict some loss on the British,
but we cannot know how we may succeed in manslaying.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Then Swein and Höldbodi went out on an expedition
with five ships. They plundered in Bretland, landing at a
place called Jarlsness,<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c017'><sup>[358]</sup></a> and committing great ravages. One
morning they went into a certain village, and met with a
little resistance. The inhabitants fled from the village, and
Swein and his men plundered everything, and burnt six
homesteads before dinner. An Icelander, named Eirík was
with Swein, and sang the following:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Half-a-dozen homesteads burning,</div>
      <div class='line'>Half-a-dozen households plundered:</div>
      <div class='line'>This was Swein’s work of a morning—</div>
      <div class='line'>This his vengeance; coals he lent them.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>After this they went to their ships. They were out
reiving all the summer, and obtained much booty, but Höld
fled into an island called Lund,<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c017'><sup>[359]</sup></a> where there was a strong
place. Swein besieged it for some time, to no purpose. In
the autumn they went back to the Isle of Man.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF SWEIN AND HOLDBÖDI’S RAIDS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>This</span> winter Swein married Ingirid, and remained there,
greatly honoured. In the spring he gathered men together,
and went to see Höldbodi, and asked for his assistance, but
he excused himself, saying that many of his men were occupied,
and some on trading trips; so Swein got none there.
But the truth was, that he had secretly made peace with
Höld, and confirmed their alliance by exchanging presents.
Swein went out, nevertheless, with three ships, but made
little booty in the earlier part of the summer. Later they
went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to
some monks in Syllingar,<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c017'><sup>[360]</sup></a> and plundered it. He made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>inroads in Ireland in many places, obtained a large booty,
and returned to the Isle of Man in autumn.</p>
<p class='c008'>When Swein had been a short time at home, he heard a
report to the effect that Höldbodi was not faithful to him,
but Swein shrank from believing it. One night in the spring
Swein’s watchmen came to him and said that enemies were
approaching them. Swein and his men seized their arms,
and ran out, and saw a great number of men carrying fire to
the homestead. Then Swein and his men ran to a hill,
and defended themselves from it. They had a horn<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c017'><sup>[361]</sup></a>
which they sounded. The neighbourhood was thickly inhabited,
and men came flocking to help Swein, so that the
assailants at last gave way. Swein and his men pursued
them, and killed many in the flight, but many of both sides
were wounded before they parted. The chief of the attacking
band was Höldbodi. He escaped in the flight, and did
not stop till he came to Lundey (Lundy Isle). Höld received
him well, and they remained together. Swein went home,
and kept a large number of his men about him, maintaining
a strict watch, because he distrusted the Sudreyarmen.
Late in the winter he sold his lands, and went early in
the spring to Liódhús (Lewis). During this expedition he
had committed many ravages.</p>

<h3 id='ch-lxxiv' class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL ROGNVALD AND SWEIN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>While</span> Swein was in the Sudreyar, Earl Rögnvald went over
to Caithness, and was entertained at Vík (Wick) by a man
named Harald. His son was named Swein, an active fellow.
While the Earl was there, Thorbiörn Klerk came up from
Scotland, and said that his father, Thorstein Höld, had been
killed by a certain Earl. People talked of how frequently
Earl Rögnvald and Thorbiörn spoke together, because the
Earl scarcely took leisure to discharge his duties for that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>reason. Thorbiörn went with the Earl out to the Islands
(Orkneys), and Swein, Harald’s son, became the Earl’s tableboy
Thorbiörn had been in Scotland for some time. He
had slain two men who had been with Swein, Asleif’s son,
at the burning of Frákork.</p>
<p class='c008'>When Swein came from the Sudreyar, he went home to
his farm in Gáreksey (Gairsay), and not to Earl Rögnvald,
as he used to do when he came from his expeditions. So
when the Earl heard that Swein had come home from the
Sudreyar in the summer, he asked Thorbiörn for what reason
he thought Swein did not come to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorbiörn replied: “I suppose Swein is offended with
me because I had those men slain who were with him at the
burning of Frákork.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said: “I do not like you to be enemies.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Earl Rögnvald went to Gáreksey, and tried to
reconcile them, which was easy, because they both wished
the Earl to judge between them. Then he made peace
between them, and it lasted for a long time after.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL ROGNVALD’S PLEASANTRIES.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>At</span> this time there came a certain Icelandic ship to the
Orkneys, in which was a man by name Hall, the son of
Thórarinn Breidmagi (broad waist). He went to Rínarsey
(North Ronaldsay), to stay with Thorstein and Ragna. He
became tired of staying there, and asked Thorstein to bring
him to Earl Rögnvald. They went to see him, but the Earl
would not receive Hall. When they came home, Ragna
asked how they had succeeded, and Hall replied by a ditty:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>It was to thy own son, Ragna,</div>
      <div class='line'>(Let truth be known among the people)</div>
      <div class='line'>I gave the noble task of asking</div>
      <div class='line'>My reception ’mong the courtiers;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the generous ring-giver,</div>
      <div class='line'>Who enjoys the highest honour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Has declined my clownish service,</div>
      <div class='line'>Having plenty of the bravest.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Shortly afterwards Ragna went to see Earl Rögnvald on
this errand herself. She was so dressed that she had a
red head-gear of horse’s hair; and when the Earl saw her he
sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Never did I know before this</div>
      <div class='line'>How the ladies of the cross-bench</div>
      <div class='line'>Deck their heads with finest kerchiefs.</div>
      <div class='line'>If I use the proper language,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seems to me that this gold-wearer</div>
      <div class='line'>Hides the tresses of her hind-head</div>
      <div class='line'>With a chestnut filly’s tail-locks,</div>
      <div class='line'>And her head-dress shows her temper.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Ragna said: “Now the saying comes true, ‘that few are
so wise that they see everything as it is,’ for this [hair] is of
a horse, and not of a mare.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then she took a silken kerchief and wrapped it round
her head, continuing, nevertheless, her business with the
Earl. He gave her a rather cold answer at first, but became
more pleasant as they spoke longer, and she obtained what
she wanted—namely, to procure for Hall a place at the
(Earl’s) court. He remained a long time with Earl Rögnvald.
They made jointly the “Old Metrekey,”<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c017'><sup>[362]</sup></a> with five
verses for each different metre. Afterwards that was thought
too much, and now two verses only are made for each different
metre.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL ROGNVALD AND SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Swein</span>, Asleif’s son, is said to have heard that Höldbodi had
arrived in the Sudreyar. Then he asked Earl Rögnvald to
give him troops to avenge himself. The Earl gave him five
ships, and Thorbiörn Klerk was the commander of one of
them; Haflidi, the son of Thorkel Flettir, of another; Dúfniál,
the son of Hávard, Gunni’s son, the third; Rikgard
(Richard), Thorleif’s son, the fourth; and Swein, Asleif’s son,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the fifth. When Höldbodi heard of Swein, he fled from the
Sudreyar. Swein and his men killed many people in the
Sudreyar, and ravaged and burnt far and wide. They
obtained great booty, but could not catch Höldbodi, and he
never came to the Sudreyar after that. Swein wished to
remain in the Sudreyar during the winter, but Thorbiörn and
the others wished to go home, and went in the autumn to
Caithness, and arrived at Dungalsbæ. When they were
going to divide their booty, Swein said they should all share
equally, but that he himself should have a chief’s share
besides, saying that he had been the chief, and that the
Earl had sent the others to his assistance. Besides, he
added further that he alone had the quarrel with the Sudreyarmen,
while the others had none. Thorbiörn, however, said
he did not deserve less than Swein, and had not been less a
leader than he. They also wished that all the ships’ commanders
should have equal shares; but they had to submit
to Swein, because his men were by far the most numerous
there on the Ness (in Caithness).</p>
<p class='c008'>Thorbiörn went out to the Orkneys and told Earl Rögnvald
how matters had gone between him and Swein, and
that they were very much displeased to have been deprived
by him of their just proportion of the spoil.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said it would not be only once that Swein had
turned out not to be an equitable man, yet he would in the
end receive retribution for his injustice; but, he added: “You
shall not quarrel about this. I shall give you as much money
of my own as you have lost through him, and it is my will
that you do not claim it of him. It will be a good thing if
this does not lead to greater difficulties with him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorbiörn replied: “May God reward you, my lord, for
the honour you do us, and we shall not quarrel with Swein
about this; but I shall never be his friend any more, and I
shall do him some despite in return.” And after that Thorbiörn
divorced himself from Ingirid, Swein’s sister, and sent
her to him over to Ness (Caithness). Swein received her
well, but considered Thorbiörn’s conduct a great insult to
himself. There was then fierce enmity between them. Then
the saying proved true that monsters are best matched
together.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>When Swein was in the Sudreyar, he had placed Margad,
Grím’s son, over his affairs at Dungalsbæ, and transferred to
him the office (of deputy or factor) which he held from Earl
Rögnvald, but Margad was resentful and overbearing, and
became unpopular on account of his violence. Those who
were the first objects of his oppression ran to Hróald (at
Wick), and remained there. From this enmity arose between
the two. Shortly after Margad went south to Vík (Wick)
on business with nineteen men, and before he left he attacked
Hróald, and killed him and several others. Then he went
to Dungalsbæ to see Swein. The latter gathered men
together, and went to Lambaborg,<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c017'><sup>[363]</sup></a> where he fortified himself.
It was a strong place, and there he remained, with sixty men,
and brought thither provisions and other necessaries. The
borg (castle) was situated on a sea-girt rock, and on the landward
side there was a well-built stone wall. The crags ran
a long way along the sea on either side. Swein and his men
committed many violent robberies in Caithness, and brought
everything into the stronghold, and became greatly hated.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON’S MOVEMENTS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>This</span> news came to the ears of Earl Rögnvald, and Swein,
Hróald’s son, and he asked the Earl to help him to obtain
redress in this cause; and many supported Swein’s request.
At last Earl Rögnvald crossed over to Ness (Caithness), and
the following chiefs with him:—Thorbiörn; Haflidi, Thorkel’s
son; and Dúfniál, Hávard’s son. These counselled the
most severe measures against Swein. They went to Dungalsbæ,
but Swein was not there. They heard that he was
in Lambaborg, and then the Earl went thither. When they
came to the borg, Swein asked who their leader was, and he
was told that it was Earl Rögnvald. Swein asked him what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>he wanted. The Earl said he wished him to deliver Margad
up to them. Swein asked whether he was to receive quarter.
The Earl said he would not promise. Then Swein said: “I
have not the heart to deliver Margad into the power of Swein,
Hróald’s son, or of my other enemies who are with you, but
I should wish very much to be at peace with you, my lord.”</p>
<p class='c008'>Then Thorbiörn Klerk said: “Hear what the traitor
says, that he would willingly be at peace with his lord after
he has plundered his land, and betaken himself to the highways
like a thief. You make a bad return to the Earl for all
the honour he has done you, and so you will do to all you can.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein replied: “You need not say much in this case,
Thorbiörn, for no respect will be paid to your words. But
it is my foreboding that you will repay him worse for all the
honour he has done to you, before you part, for nobody will
gain good fortune from any dealings with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Earl Rögnvald said that men should not rail at each
other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they besieged the borg, and cut off all communication,
and a long time passed, as they could not make an
assault. And when the provisions were exhausted, Swein
called his men together, and consulted with them. But they
all said, as with one mouth, that they wished to follow his
guidance as long as they were able.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Swein said: “I think it most disgraceful to starve
here, and afterwards to surrender to our enemies. It has
turned out, as was likely, that our skill and good fortune
should fail against Earl Rögnvald. We have tried to obtain
peace and security for life, but neither was to be had for my
companion Margad. Though I know that the others will be
able to obtain quarter, yet I have not the heart to deliver
him under the axe. Still, it is not right that so many here
should suffer for his difficulties, although I am unwilling to
part from him for a time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he tied together ropes which they had, and during
the night they let Swein and Margad down from the borg
into the sea. They swam along the cliffs till they came to
the end of them, then they got on shore and went to Sutherland,
thence to Moray, and then to Dúfeyrar.<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c017'><sup>[364]</sup></a> There they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>met with some Orkneymen in a trading vessel. Hallvard
and Thorkel were the commanders, and they were ten altogether.
Swein and Margad went on board with them, when
they were twelve together, and then they sailed south off
Scotland, until they came to Máeyar (the Isle of May).
There was a monastery, the head of which was an abbot, by
name Baldwin.<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c017'><sup>[365]</sup></a> Swein and his men were detained there
seven nights by stress of weather. They said they had been
sent by Earl Rögnvald to the King of Scots. The monks
suspected their tale, and thinking they were pirates, sent to
the mainland for men. When Swein and his comrades
became aware of this, they went hastily on board their ship,
after having plundered much treasure from the monastery.
They went in along Myrkvifiörd (the Firth of Forth), and
found David, the King of Scots, in Edinburgh. He received
Swein well, and requested him to stay with him. He told
the King explicitly the reason of his visit, how matters had
gone between him and Earl Rögnvald before they parted, and
also that they had plundered in Máeyar. Swein and Margad
stayed for a while with the King of Scots, and were well
treated. King David sent men to those who had been robbed
by Swein, and told them to estimate their loss themselves, and
then of his own money he made good to every one his loss.</p>

<p class='c008'>King David proposed to Swein to bring his wife from
the Orkneys, and to bestow upon him such honours in
Scotland as he might be well satisfied with. Swein declared
all his wishes to the King. He said it was his wish
that Margad should remain with him, and that the King
should send word to Earl Rögnvald to be reconciled to him;
but he said he would himself leave his case entirely to the
decision of Rögnvald, adding that he was always well pleased
when there was friendship between them, but ill at ease
when they were at enmity.</p>

<p class='c008'>King David replied: “I suppose this Earl is a good
man, and you value nothing except what comes from him,
since you prefer the risk of surrendering yourself to his
good faith, and refuse my offers.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Swein said he would never give up his friendship, yet
he asked the King to grant him this, and the King said it
should be as he wished.</p>

<p class='c008'>King David sent men to the Orkneys with presents, and
a message requesting that the Earl would make peace with
Swein. Then Swein went north to the Islands, and Margad
remained behind with the King. King David’s messengers
went to Earl Rögnvald, who received them well, and also
the presents, promising peace to Swein. Then he was fully
reconciled to Swein, who now returned to his estates.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL VALTHIÓF’S DEATH.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Swein and Margad had left Lambaborg,<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c017'><sup>[366]</sup></a> those that
were in the fort resolved to surrender it to Earl Rögnvald.
He asked them what they knew last of Swein and Margad,
and they told the truth.</p>
<p class='c008'>When the Earl heard it, he said: “To tell the truth,
Swein has no equal among those that are now with us, and
such feats are both brave and hardy; but I will not abuse
my power over you, although you were involved in these
troubles with Swein. Every one of you shall go home in
peace as far as I am concerned.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl went home to the Orkneys, and sent Thorbiörn
Klerk in a ship with forty men south to Breidafiord (the Moray
Firth), to search for Swein; but he heard nothing of him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorbiörn then said to his men: “Our journey is a
strange one; we are all this time wandering after Swein,
but I have heard that Earl Valthióf, who slew my father,<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c017'><sup>[367]</sup></a>
is not far off, with but a few men; and if you will attack
him with me, I will promise you that I shall not act as
Swein did—namely, to deprive you of your share if we get
any booty, for you shall have all we get, except what you
wish to give me, because I think glory is better than booty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they went to the place where Earl Valthióf was at
a banquet, and surprised them in the house, and set it on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>fire immediately. Valthióf and his men ran to the door,
and asked who was the raiser of the fire. Thorbiörn told his
name. Valthióf offered compensation for Thorstein’s slaying,
but Thorbiörn said it was useless to ask for peace. They
defended themselves bravely for a time; but when the fire
pressed them they ran out; after that their defence was
short, because the fire had overcome them. Earl Valthióf
fell, and thirty men with him. Thorbiörn and his men got
a great deal of booty, and he kept all his promises to them
faithfully. Then they went to the Orkneys to Earl Rögnvald,
who was well satisfied with what they had done.
Then there was peace and quiet in the Islands.</p>

<p class='c008'>At that time a young man lived in the Islands,<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c017'><sup>[368]</sup></a> by
name Kolbein Hruga (heap), a very overbearing man; he
built a fine stone castle,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c017'><sup>[369]</sup></a> which was a strong defence. Kolbein’s
wife was Herbiörg, the sister of Hákon Barn (child),
but their mother was the daughter of Herborg, Paul’s
daughter. Their children were Kolbein Karl, Bjarni Skáld,
Sumarlidi, Aslák, and Frída; they were all well mannered.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EINDRIDI UNGI (THE YOUNG).</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>At</span> that time the sons of Harald Gilli<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c017'><sup>[370]</sup></a> ruled over Norway.
Eystein was the oldest of them, but Ingi was a legitimate
son, and he was most honoured by the Lendermen, because
he let them have their way in all things as they liked. At
this time the following Lendermen (Barons) assisted him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the government:—Ogmund and Erling, the son of Kyrpinga
Orm. They advised King Ingi to send word to Earl Rögnvald,
and give him an honourable invitation, saying truly that
he had been a great friend of his father, and desired him to
become as intimate with the Earl as he could, so that he
might be a dearer friend of his than of his brother, whatever
might happen between them. The Earl was related to the
brothers, and a great friend of theirs; and when he received
this message, he quickly prepared to go, because he felt a
desire to go to Norway to see his friends and kinsmen. Earl
Harald asked to be permitted to go with him, out of curiosity
and to amuse himself; he was then nineteen winters old.</p>
<p class='c008'>When the Earls were ready, they started from the west
with some merchants, having a noble retinue, and arrived in
Norway early in the spring. They found King Ingi in
Biörgvin (Bergen), and he received them very well. Earl
Rögnvald saw many of his friends and kinsmen, and spent a
great deal of the summer there. Eindridi Ungi (the young)
arrived from Mikligard (Constantinople) that summer; he
had been long in service<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c017'><sup>[371]</sup></a> there, and was able to tell many
things from there; and it was thought good entertainment
to inquire from him about things in that part of the world.
The Earl conversed frequently with him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Once when they were talking, Eindridi said: “It seems
strange to me that you do not think of going out to Jórsalaheim
(Jerusalem), and that you should be satisfied with
being told of the things that are there; it would best suit
such men as you are to be there on account of your great
accomplishments, and you will be honoured above all others
wherever you come among noble men.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Eindridi had said this, many spoke in favour of
it, and exhorted the Earl to become the leader of such an
expedition. Erling made a long speech in support of the
proposal, and said he would join the party himself, if the
Earl would consent to be their chief. And as many men of
note seemed eager for the journey, he promised to go. And
when he and Erling were settling matters between them,
many noble men joined the party. These Lendermen
(Barons) were among them: Eindridi Ungi, who was to be
their guide, Jón Pétrsson, Aslák Erlendsson, Guttorm Möl,
and Kol from Halland. It was resolved that none of them
should have a larger ship than with thirty benches, except
the Earl, and no one should have an ornamented vessel but
he. This was done in order that no one should envy another
because he had finer men or a better ship than he.
Jón Fót (leg) was to build a ship for the Earl, and to have
it as finely fitted out as possible. Earl Rögnvald went
home in the autumn, and intended to stay at home two
winters. King Ingi gave the Earl two long ships—small,
but very beautiful, and specially built for rowing; they
were, therefore, of all the ships the swiftest. Earl Rögnvald
gave Harald one of them, called Fífa; the other was called
Hjálp. In these ships the Earls went to sea, holding westward.
Earl Rögnvald had received large presents from his
friends. It was Tuesday evening when the Earls put out to
sea, and they had a fair wind during the night. On
Wednesday there was a great storm, and in the evening
they saw land. It was very dark, and they saw signs of
breakers surrounding them on all sides. Up to this time
they had kept together. There was nothing to be done
except to run the vessels on shore, and this they did.<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c017'><sup>[372]</sup></a> The
beach before them was stony and narrow, enclosed behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>by crags. All the men were saved, but they lost a large
quantity of their stores. Some of the things were thrown
up by the sea during the night. As usual, Earl Rögnvald
bore himself as the bravest of all the men there. He
was so merry that he played with his fingers, and spoke
nearly all his sayings in rhyme. He took a golden ring
from his hand, and sang this ditty:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Thus I hang the hammer-beaten</div>
      <div class='line'>Hand-ring from my rounded fingers;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus I put my fingers through it:</div>
      <div class='line'>So the nymph of crashing waters</div>
      <div class='line'>Threw me, joyful, in a rock-rift</div>
      <div class='line'>There to play me with my fingers.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>When they had carried their things up from the sea,
they went farther inland to search for habitations, because
they thought they knew they had landed in Hjaltland.
They soon found farms, and distributed themselves among
them. The people were glad to see the Earl, and when he
was asked about his voyage, he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Both my ships on beach went crashing;</div>
      <div class='line'>When the surges swept my men off,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sore afflicted by the billows</div>
      <div class='line'>Were the friends of Hjalp and Fífa.</div>
      <div class='line'>Certainly this misadventure</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the danger-seeking rovers</div>
      <div class='line'>Will not soon be quite forgotten</div>
      <div class='line'>By those who got such a wetting.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The mistress of the house brought a fur cloak to the Earl,
who, stretching his hands forward to receive it, and laughing,
sang this ditty:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here I shake a shrunken fur coat;</div>
      <div class='line'>Surely ’tis not ornamental.</div>
      <div class='line'>All our clothes are in the ship-field,</div>
      <div class='line'>And it is too wide to seek them.</div>
      <div class='line'>Lately, all the young sea-horses</div>
      <div class='line'>Left we dressed in splendid garments,</div>
      <div class='line'>As we drove the steeds of mast-heads</div>
      <div class='line'>To the crags, across the surges.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Large fires were made, and there they warmed themselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>A female servant entered shivering all over, and her
words were unintelligible on account of her shiver. The
Earl said he understood her:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Asa! you seem quite exhausted.</div>
      <div class='line'>Atatata! ’tis the water.</div>
      <div class='line'>Hutututu! where shall I sit?</div>
      <div class='line'>By the fire—’tis rather chilly.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Earl sent twelve of his men to Einar in Gullberuvík,
but he said he would not receive them unless the Earl
came himself. When Earl Rögnvald heard this, he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Einar said he would give food to</div>
      <div class='line'>None of all the lads of Rögnvald,</div>
      <div class='line'>He himself alone excepted—</div>
      <div class='line'>(Empty words I now am talking),</div>
      <div class='line'>For I know that he, the friendly,</div>
      <div class='line'>Never failed to keep his promise.</div>
      <div class='line'>Go we in then where the fires are</div>
      <div class='line'>Burning brightly all the evening.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Earl stayed a long time in Hjaltland, and in the
autumn he went south to the Orkneys, and resided in his
dominions. That autumn two Hjaltlanders<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c017'><sup>[373]</sup></a> came to him.
One was named Armód, a poet; the other was Oddi the
little, the son of Glúm: he made verses well. The Earl
received them both as his men. The Earl had a grand
Yule feast, to which he invited guests, and gave his men
presents. He handed a spear, inlaid with gold, to the poet
Armód, shook it at him, and told him to make a song on the
spur of the moment:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Princely gifts the battle-fanner</div>
      <div class='line'>With no niggard hand distributes:</div>
      <div class='line'>Scaldic honours are not measured</div>
      <div class='line'>By the gifts bestowed on others.</div>
      <div class='line'>The defender of his country,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the best of all commanders,</div>
      <div class='line'>With his own hand brings to Armód</div>
      <div class='line'>This blood-candle, golden pointed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>One day during Yule the guests were looking at the
tapestry. The Earl said to Oddi the little: “Make a song
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>about the workman’s handicraft on the tapestry, and have it
made by the time that I have finished my stanza, and use
none of the same words that are in mine.” The Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The old one on the hangings standing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Has a sheath-rod on his shoulder,</div>
      <div class='line'>But, in spite of all his anger,</div>
      <div class='line'>He will not get one step farther.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Oddi sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>For a stroke himself prepares the</div>
      <div class='line'>Warrior in stooping posture,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the tapestry is parted;</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet his danger will be greatest.</div>
      <div class='line'>Time it is for ships’ commanders</div>
      <div class='line'>Peace to make ere harm does happen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>During Yule-tide, the Earl entertained Bishop William
and many of his chiefs. Then he made known his intention
to go to Jórsalaheim (Jerusalem), and requested the Bishop
to go with him, because he was a good Parisian scholar,<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c017'><sup>[374]</sup></a> and
the Earl wished him to be their interpreter. The Bishop
agreed to the Earl’s request, and promised to go. The following
chiefs went with Earl Rögnvald:—Magnus, the son
of Hávard, Gunni’s son; Swein, Hróald’s son; and the following
men of lesser note:—Thorgeir Skotakoll, Oddi the
little, Thorberg Svarti, Armód the scald, Thorkel Krókauga,
Grímkell of Flettuness, and Bjarni his son. When the two
winters appointed for their preparations were passed, Earl
Rögnvald went early in the spring from the Orkneys east to
Norway, to see how far the Lendermen (Barons) had progressed
with their preparations; and when he came to
Biörgvin, he found there Erling, Jón, his brother-in-law, and
Aslák, but Guttorm arrived shortly after. To Biörgvin came
also the ship which Jón Fót had caused to be built for the
Earl. It was a most exquisite piece of workmanship, and
all ornamented. The whole of the carved work on the prow,
the vanes, and many other parts of the ship, were gilt.
Altogether, it was a most splendid ship. Eindridi came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>frequently to town during the summer, and said he should
be ready in a week. The Earl’s men murmured greatly at
having to wait so long, and some proposed not to wait for
him, saying that such voyages as this had been made without
Eindridi. A short time after Eindridi came to town and said
he was ready. Then the Earl commanded his men to set sail
when they thought there was favourable wind; and when the
day came when they thought they might expect a favourable
wind, they left the town, and set sail. The breeze was faint,
and the Earl’s ship moved slowly, because it required strong
wind. The other chiefs lowered their sails, and would not
leave the Earl. When they were outside the Islands, the
breeze increased to such a degree that in the smaller vessels
they had to take in sail, but the Earl’s ship now went at a
great speed. They saw two large ships coming after them,
and soon they passed them. One of these two ships was
highly finished. It was a dragon; both its head and stem
were richly gilded; it was white on the bows, and painted
everywhere above the sea where it was thought it would look
well. The Earl’s men said that was very likely Eindridi’s,
adding: “He has not kept well the agreement that no one
should have an ornamented ship except you, sire.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “Eindridi’s pride is great, and he may
be excused for not liking to be on the same level with us,
as we are so much his inferiors; but it is difficult to see
whether his good fortune runs before him or goes along with
him. But let us not direct our movements according to his
hotheadedness.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Eindridi soon passed them in the larger vessel, but the
Earl kept all his ships together, and had a successful voyage.
They arrived all safe in the Orkneys in the autumn.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL ROGNVALD AND THE ORKNEYMEN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>It</span> was resolved that they should spend the winter there.
Some lived at their own expense, others were quartered with
the Bœndr, and many were with the Earl. There was a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>turmoil in the Islands; the Orkneymen and the Eastmen
quarrelled frequently about bargains, and women, and other
things. The Earl had a very difficult task to keep peace
among them, for both parties considered that he deserved
well of them and they of him.</p>
<div id='i-dragon-ship'  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/dragon-ship.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>DRAGON SHIP OF THE VIKING PERIOD<br />(from Holmberg’s Nordbon i Hednatiden.)</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Of Eindridi it is to be told that when they came to
Hjaltland (Shetland) his fine ship was totally wrecked, and
he lost a great quantity of goods, but the smaller ship was
saved. He spent the winter in Hjaltland, and sent men to
Norway to have another ship built for the voyage to the
East.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of Eindridi’s crew was called Arni Spítulegg (stick-leg).
He went to the Orkneys during the winter with nine
men. Arni was a very violent man, daring and turbulent.
He and his comrades lived at their own expense during the
winter. He bought malt and meat of a tenant of Swein,
Asleif’s son, and when he demanded payment Arni delayed
to pay. When he demanded it a second time, he was overwhelmed
with abuse; and before they parted Arni struck him
with the back of his axe, saying, “Go and tell your champion,
Swein, whom you are always praising, to obtain redress
for you; you will need no more.” The man went and told
Swein, requesting him to obtain redress. He gave him a
cold answer, and said he would promise nothing. One day
in the spring Swein went to collect his rents. They were
four together in a ten-oared boat. They had to pass the
island in which Arni was staying, and Swein said he would
land there. It was ebbing tide. Swein went on shore alone,
carrying an axe with a short handle, and no other weapon.
He told his men to keep the boat from getting aground.
Arni Spítulegg and his comrades were lying in an outhouse
not far from the sea. Swein walked up, and found them
indoors. They greeted him. He acknowledged their greeting,
and spoke to Arni, saying that he should settle the
farmer’s account. Arni replied that there was plenty of
time for that. Swein asked him to do it for his intercession,
but still Arni refused. Then Swein said he would not ask
any further, and at the same time he drove the axe into
Arni’s skull, so that the iron was buried in it, and he lost
hold of the handle. Swein ran out, and Arni’s companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>after him, to the beach. As they ran fast along the muddy
shore, one of them, who was the swiftest, came to close quarters
with him. There were large roots of seaweed lying in
the mud. Swein seized one of them, and thrust it into the
face of the man who had come up with him, and he grasped
at his eyes to clear the mud away, but Swein escaped to his
boat, and went home to Gáreksey. Shortly after he went on
his own business over to Caithness, and sent word to Earl
Rögnvald to settle the matter about Arni Spítulegg’s slaying.
And when the Earl received the message, he summoned
together those who were entitled to compensation for Arni,
and settled the matter to their satisfaction, he himself paying
the compensation money. Many other acts of violence perpetrated
by the Eastmen and the Orkneymen during the
winter the Earl made good out of his own [funds].</p>

<p class='c008'>Early in the spring he called a Thing meeting in Hrossey
(Mainland), to which came all the chiefs residing in his
dominions. He then made it known to them that he intended
to leave the Orkneys and to go to Jórsalaheim (Jerusalem),
saying that he would leave the government in the hands of
his kinsman Harald, and praying all his friends to obey him,
and help him faithfully in whatever he required while he
was obliged to be away himself. Earl Harald was then
nearly twenty, tall and strong, but ugly; yet he was a wise
man, and the people thought he would be a good chief.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the summer Earl Rögnvald prepared to leave the
Orkneys; but the summer was far advanced before he was
ready, because he had to wait a long time for Eindridi until
his ship came from Norway. When they were ready, they
left the Orkneys in fifteen large ships. The following were
commanders of ships:—Earl Rögnvald; Erling Skakki;
Bishop William; Aslák, Erlend’s son; Guttorm; Magnus,
Hávard’s son; Swein, Hróald’s son; Eindridi Ungi; and the
others who were with him are not named. From the Orkneys
they sailed to Scotland, and then to England, and when they
sailed to Nordymbraland (Northumberland), off the mouth of
Hvera (the Wear), Armód sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>High the crests were of the billows</div>
      <div class='line'>As we passed the mouth of Hvera;</div>
      <div class='line'>Masts were bending, and the low land</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>Met the waves in long sand reaches;</div>
      <div class='line'>Blind our eyes were with the salt spray</div>
      <div class='line'>While the youths at home remaining,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the Thing-field fare on horseback.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then they sailed till they were south off England, and so on
to Valland.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c017'><sup>[375]</sup></a> There is no account of their voyage until they
came to a seaport called Verbon (Nerbon).<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c017'><sup>[376]</sup></a> There they learned that
the Earl who had governed the city, and whose name was
Geirbiörn, had lately died; but left a young and beautiful
daughter, by name Ermingerd. She had charge of her patrimony,
under the guardianship of her noblest kinsmen. They
advised the Queen to invite Earl Rögnvald to a splendid
banquet, saying that her fame would spread far if she gave
a fitting reception to noblemen arrived from such a distance.
The Queen left it to them; and when this had been resolved
upon, men were sent to the Earl to tell him that the Queen
invited him to a banquet, with as many men as he himself
wished to accompany him. The Earl received her invitation
gratefully, selecting the best of his men to go with him.
And when they came to the banquet there was good cheer,
and nothing was spared by which the Earl might consider
himself specially honoured. One day, while the Earl sat at
the feast, the Queen entered the hall, attended by many
ladies. She had in her hand a golden cup, and was arrayed
in the finest robes. She wore her hair loose, according to the
custom of maidens, and a golden diadem round her forehead.
She poured out for the Earl, and the maidens played for
them. The Earl took her hand along with the cup, and
placed her beside him. They conversed during the day.
The Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lady fair! thy form surpasses</div>
      <div class='line'>All the loveliness of maidens,</div>
      <div class='line'>Though arrayed in costly garments,</div>
      <div class='line'>And adorned with precious jewels:</div>
      <div class='line'>Silken curls in radiant splendour</div>
      <div class='line'>Fall upon the beauteous shoulders</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the goddess of the gold-rings.</div>
      <div class='line'>The greedy eagle’s claws I redden’d.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>The Earl stayed there a long time, and was well entertained.
The inhabitants of the city solicited him to take up his residence
there, saying that they were in favour of giving the
Queen to him in marriage. The Earl said he wished to
complete his intended journey, but that he would come there
on his return, and then they might do what they thought fit.
Then the Earl left with his retinue, and sailed round Thrasness.
They had a fair wind, and sat and drank, and made
themselves merry. The Earl sang this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Long in the Prince’s memory</div>
      <div class='line'>Ermingerda’s soft words shall linger;</div>
      <div class='line'>It is her desire that we shall</div>
      <div class='line'>Ride the waters out to Jordan;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the riders of sea-horses,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the southern climes returning,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon shall plough their way to Verbon</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the whale-pond in the autumn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then Armód sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ne’er shall I see Ermingerda</div>
      <div class='line'>More, from this time, if it be not</div>
      <div class='line'>That my fate shall be propitious;</div>
      <div class='line'>Many now are grieving for her.</div>
      <div class='line'>Happy were I if I could but</div>
      <div class='line'>Be beside her just for one day;</div>
      <div class='line'>That, indeed, would be good fortune,</div>
      <div class='line'>Once again to see her fair face.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then Oddi sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Truth to tell, we two are scarcely</div>
      <div class='line'>Worthy of fair Ermingerda;</div>
      <div class='line'>For this wise and lovely Princess</div>
      <div class='line'>May be called the Queen of Maidens:</div>
      <div class='line'>This the title that beseemeth</div>
      <div class='line'>Best the splendour of her beauty.</div>
      <div class='line'>While she lives beneath the sun-ray,</div>
      <div class='line'>May her lot be ever happy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>They went on till they came west to Galicialand,<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c017'><sup>[377]</sup></a> five
nights before Yule-tide, and intended to spend it there. They
asked the inhabitants whether they were willing to sell them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>provisions; but food is scarce in that country, and they
thought it a great hardship to have to feed such a numerous
host. It so happened that the country was under the rule
of a foreigner, who resided in the castle, and oppressed the
inhabitants greatly. He made war on them if they did not
do everything he wished, and menaced them with violence
and oppression. When the Earl asked the inhabitants to
sell him victuals, they consented to do so until Lent, but
made certain proposals on their part—to wit, that Earl
Rögnvald should attack their enemies, and should have all
the money which he might obtain from them. The Earl
communicated this to his men, and asked them what they
would be inclined to do. Most of them were willing to
attack the castle, thinking that it was a very likely place to
obtain booty. Therefore Earl Rögnvald and his men agreed
to the terms of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Yule-tide was close at hand the Earl called his
men together, and said: “We have been resting for a while, and
have not disturbed the men of the castle, and the inhabitants
are getting tired of supplying us. I suppose they will think
our promise will come to nothing; and it is not manly in us
not to try to do what we promised. Now, I wish to hear
your advice as to how we are to take the castle, as I know
you here are men of great discretion; therefore I ask every
one here present to state what plan he thinks most likely to
succeed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Erling replied to the Earl, and said: “I will not be silent
since you command us to speak, although I am not a man of
sage counsels; and those ought rather to be asked who have
seen more and are more experienced in such undertakings,
as Eindridi Ungi. But I suppose we must do here as the
saying is, ‘Shoot at the bird before we catch it.’ I may try
to give some advice, whatever may be its value. If you and
the other ship-commanders do not think it a bad plan, we
shall to-day go all of us to the wood, and carry three bundles
of faggots each to the castle, because it appears to me that
the lime would not stand well if much heat were applied to it.
Let us do this for the next three days, and see what happens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They did as Erling advised, and when they had finished
their work Yule was close at hand. The Bishop would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>permit the inhabitants of the castle to be attacked during the
Yule-tide.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chief inhabiting the castle was named Gudifrey. He
was a wise man, and somewhat advanced in years. He was
a good scholar, had travelled much, and knew many languages.
He was a covetous man, and overbearing.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he saw what the strangers were doing, he called
his men together, and said: “The plan adopted by the Northmen
seems to me a wise one, and likely to do us great harm.
We shall see, when fire is applied to the stone wall round
the castle, that it is not strong. Moreover, the Northmen
are valiant, and men of great strength, and we may expect a
fierce attack from them if they get an opportunity. Now, I
wish to hear your advice about the difficult position in which
we are placed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But all his men asked him to do what he thought best.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he said: “My first plan is to tie ropes together,
and you shall let me down over the castle wall. I will dress
myself in rags, and go to the camp of the Northmen, and see
what I can ascertain.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They did as he told them, and he came to Earl Rögnvald
pretending to be a beggar, and speaking Valska, as they
understood a little of it. He walked throughout the camp
and begged food. He perceived that there was much jealousy
among the Northmen, and that they were divided into two
factions. Eindridi Ungi was the leader of one, and the Earl
of the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gudifrey went to Eindridi and spoke to him. He said
that the chief of the castle had sent him there, wishing to
form an alliance with him. “He expects that you will give
him quarter if the castle is taken; and he is more willing to
let you have his treasure, if you will do this in return, than
those who wish to have him a dead man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Such things they spoke, and many others, but it was
concealed from the Earl, as at first they observed profound
secrecy. When Gudifrey had been some time with the Earl’s
men, he returned to his castle. But they did not remove
their property from it, because they did not know whether
the attack would be successful, and they could not put faith
in the inhabitants.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL ROGNVALD TAKES A CASTLE.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> tenth day of Yule-tide was a fine day, and Earl Rögnvald
arose and commanded his men to arm themselves, and
summoned them with trumpets to the attack of the castle.
They dragged the wood close to it, and heaped up large piles
round the walls. Then the Earl gave orders where each
should make the attack. He himself with the Orkneymen
had the attack from the south, Erling and Aslák from the
west, Jón and Guttorm from the east, and Eindridi Ungi
from the north. When they were ready for the attack, they
set fire to the wood, and the Earl sang:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Maids in lace and snow-white linen</div>
      <div class='line'>Bring us here the white wine sparkling.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fair to see was Ermingerda,</div>
      <div class='line'>When we met her in our travels.</div>
      <div class='line'>Fare we now to try the castle</div>
      <div class='line'>With our flaming oaken firebrands;</div>
      <div class='line'>Quickly leaping from the scabbard</div>
      <div class='line'>Gleams the sharp-edged smiter. Forward!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Now they began to attack the castle vigorously, both with
weapons and with fire. They shot missiles into it, for that
was the only way of attack. The besieged did not stand
firm on the walls, because they had to guard themselves
against the missiles. They poured down burning pitch and
brimstone, which, however, did very little harm to the Earl’s
men. What Erling had foretold came to pass; the lime
could not stand the fire, and the wall fell down, leaving large
breaches open.</p>

<p class='c008'>A man named Sigmund Ongul (fish-hook), the Earl’s
stepson, was one of the keenest in the attack, and frequently
went in front of the Earl, although he was then hardly a
full-grown man. When the attack had lasted for a while,
all the besieged were driven from the wall. The wind blew
from the south, and drove all the smoke towards Eindridi,
and when the fire began to spread rapidly the Earl had water
poured on it to cool the burnt stones, and then there was a
short pause in the attack. The Earl sang a song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>Now I mind me of the Yule-tide</div>

      <div class='line'>Adding to the din of weapons.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Further he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Glad I was when that fair lady</div>

      <div class='line'>Hopelessly was I led captive</div>
      <div class='line'>By a Valland maid in autumn.</div>
      <div class='line'>Still I love the noble lady,</div>
      <div class='line'>And I spread the feast for eagles.</div>
      <div class='line'>Stone and lime, well bound together,</div>
      <div class='line'>Now before me fall asunder.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then Sigmund Ongul sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When, in spring-time, o’er the waters</div>
      <div class='line'>Ye go homeward to the Orkneys,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tell the lady whom I most love—</div>
      <div class='line'>Lady of the splendid garments—</div>
      <div class='line'>That, beneath the castle ramparts,</div>
      <div class='line'>There was none who stepped more boldly</div>
      <div class='line'>’Mong the young men than her lover.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then the Earl and Sigmund prepared to force their way
into the castle, and meeting with little resistance, they entered
it, and many were killed; but those that surrendered to the
Earl received quarter. They obtained a great deal of property,
but did not find the chief, and almost no treasure.
There was a great discussion about the escape of Gudifrey,
and how he had effected it; and they soon suspected Eindridi
Ungi that he had given him the means of escaping, and that
he had followed the smoke, and thus gained the forest.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this Earl Rögnvald and his men stayed a short
time in Galicialand, and directed their course along the west
of Spain. They plundered far and wide in heathen Spainland,<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c017'><sup>[378]</sup></a>
and obtained great booty. They went into a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>village, but the villagers ran together and offered fight.
They made a stout resistance, but fled at last, when many of
them had been killed. The Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When in Spainland I went fighting,</div>
      <div class='line'>Quickly we o’erthrew the foemen,</div>
      <div class='line'>For, when tired of our hard hewing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Home they ran to see their sweethearts:</div>
      <div class='line'>All the land was strewed with corpses.</div>
      <div class='line'>Our deeds in song shall now be famous;</div>
      <div class='line'>And my hope is, to be worthy</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the lovely Ermingerda.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then they sailed along the west of Spain, and were overtaken
by a gale. There they lay at anchor three days, and
great waves broke over them, so that the vessels nearly foundered.
Then the Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Here I’m storm-tossed, but undaunted,</div>
      <div class='line'>While the cables hold together,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the tackle of the vessel</div>
      <div class='line'>Breaks not, as she breasts the billows;</div>
      <div class='line'>I am promised to the fair one</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom we left out in the North-land;</div>
      <div class='line'>Now again there comes a fair wind;</div>
      <div class='line'>Speed we on into the channel.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then they set sail, and ran into Njörfasund<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c017'><sup>[379]</sup></a> with a fair
wind, and Oddi sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>When the faithful friend of heroes,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the guest-hall sweet mead quaffing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sat beside the fair ring-giver,</div>
      <div class='line'>That was a week to be remembered.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now the splendid steeds of billows</div>
      <div class='line'>Bear the noble-minded Rögnvald</div>
      <div class='line'>And his warriors, wearing bucklers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Quickly through the Sound of Njörfi.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>When they were tacking into the Sound, the Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>By an east wind, breathing softly,</div>
      <div class='line'>As from lips of Valland lady,</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Are our ships now wafted onward,</div>
      <div class='line'>As we push the yards out farther;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though we had to tie the canvas</div>
      <div class='line'>Tighter than we had expected</div>
      <div class='line'>To the middle of the sailyard,</div>
      <div class='line'>South off Spain—we bear away now.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>They sailed through Njörfasund, and then the gale began to
abate; and when they had cleared the Sound, Eindridi Ungi
parted from the Earl with six ships, and sailed across the sea to
Marselia (Marseilles), but Earl Rögnvald and his men remained
at the Sound. It was said that Eindridi now himself proved
that he had allowed Gudifrey to escape. The Earl’s men
sailed out to sea, and stood southwards to Serkland.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c017'><sup>[380]</sup></a> Then
Earl Rögnvald sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now our good ship, land forsaking,</div>
      <div class='line'>Laves her breast in limpid waters.</div>
      <div class='line'>Long ere he who sings these verses,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sees again the northern islands;</div>
      <div class='line'>With the sharp prow I the yielding</div>
      <div class='line'>Earth-surrounding sea am carving,</div>
      <div class='line'>Far off Spain-land, sweeping southward.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>More is not said of the Earl’s progress till they came south
off Serkland, and lay near Sardinia, not knowing where the
land was. It was very calm, and a thick fog spread over
the water, so that they could hardly see anything from the
ships, and they sailed therefore slowly. One morning the
mist disappeared, and the crew arose and looked around and
saw two islets. When they looked for them the second time,
there was but one islet. This they told to the Earl. Then
he said: “This cannot have been islets which you have seen;
it must be ships such as they have in this part of the world,
and which they call Drómundar.<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c017'><sup>[381]</sup></a> From a distance they look
as big as holms. But where the other Drómund lay, a puff
of wind has probably swept over the water, and she has
sailed away; but they are likely some rovers.”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Then he summoned the Bishop and all the ship-commanders,
and said: “I ask of you my Lord Bishop, and
Erling my kinsman, whether you see any chance or device
by which we may overcome those in the Drómund.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bishop replied: “I think you will find it difficult
to attack the Drómund in your long-ships, for you will hardly
be able to reach their bulwarks with a boarding-pike, and
they have probably brimstone and boiling pitch to pour under
your feet and over your heads. You may see, Earl Rögnvald,
wise as you are, that it would be the greatest rashness
to place yourself and your men in such jeopardy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Erling said: “My Lord Bishop, it may be that you
are right in thinking that we shall not obtain the victory by
rowing at them; yet I cannot help thinking that if we try
to push close to the Drómund, their missiles will fall beyond
our ships lying close alongside; but if this be not the case,
we can push away quickly, for they will not be able to chase
us in the Drómund.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said: “That is bravely spoken, and very much
to my own mind. I will now make it known to the ships’
commanders and all the men, that every one may arm and
prepare himself, each in his own place, as well as he can.
Then let us attack them, and if they are Christian merchants,
we can make peace with them; but if they are heathens,
which I think they are, by the favour of Almighty God we
shall be able to overcome them, but of the booty we obtain
we shall give every fiftieth penny to the poor.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then they unfastened their arms, prepared the bulwarks
of their ships for battle, and made themselves ready in other
ways as their circumstances permitted. The Earl assigned
to each vessel its place in the attack; then they pulled
vigorously onwards.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>RÖGNVALD CONQUERS THE DRÓMUND.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> the men in the Drómund saw the ships pulling
towards them, to attack them, they spread fine clothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>and costly stuffs out on the bulwarks, and made a great
shouting, which the Earl’s men took as a challenge. Earl
Rögnvald brought his ship close under the stem of the
Drómund, on the starboard side. Erling did the same on
the larboard side. Jón and Aslák brought theirs under
her bows, and the others amidships on either side, all sticking
as close to her as possible. But when they came close
under the Drómund, she was so high in the side that the
Northmen were unable to use their weapons, and the others
poured blazing brimstone and burning pitch over them; but
most of it fell outside the ships, as Erling had foreseen, and
they had no need to shield themselves from it. However,
when the attack did not succeed, the Bishop moved away
his ship and two others, and they told off their bowmen to
go in them. After having got to a convenient distance for
shooting, they shot their arrows into the Drómund, and this
was the most effective mode of attack. The men in the
Drómund protected themselves with their shields, and paid
little heed to what those were doing who were in the ships
close under the Drómund.</p>
<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald then ordered his men to take their axes,
and cut the planks of the Drómund, where the iron fastenings
were fewest; and when the men in the other ships saw
what the Earl’s men were doing, they did the same. Now,
where Erling had stationed himself, there was a large anchor
hanging from the Drómund, which had its fluke hooked over
the gunwale, but the shank hung down towards Erling’s
ship. One of his forecastle men was named Andun Raudi
(red); he was lifted up on the anchor-stock, and then he
pulled up others. Standing there as close as they could,
they hacked away at the planks with all their might; and
this was far higher than the others could reach. When
they had made an opening large enough to admit them, they
prepared to board the Drómund. The Earl and his men
entered on the lower deck, and Erling and his men on the
upper; and when they both got in, there began to be severe
fighting. Those in the Drómund were Saracens, whom we
call Mahometan infidels. There were also many black men,
who withstood them most fiercely. Erling received a severe
wound in the neck, near the shoulder, when he jumped on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>board; it healed so badly that he carried his head to a side
ever after, and therefore he was called crick-neck (Skakki).</p>

<p class='c008'>When Earl Rögnvald and Erling joined each other, the
Saracens were driven to the forepart of the ship; and the
Earl’s men boarded one after another until they were more
numerous, and then they pressed the enemy hard. In the
Drómund they saw one man far superior to the others in
appearance and stature, and they were persuaded that he
must be their chief. Earl Rögnvald ordered his men not
to wound him, if they could seize him in any other way.
Then they surrounded him, and pressed him with their
shields, and thus caught him. He and a few others with
him were sent to the Bishop’s ship. All the rest they
killed, and obtained great booty and many precious things.
When they had finished the hardest part of their work,
they sat down and rested, and the Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>At the spreading of the banner,</div>
      <div class='line'>Erling, mighty tree of battle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Went to victory and honour</div>
      <div class='line'>Foremost when we fought the Drómund;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then we felled the black-skinned fighters;</div>
      <div class='line'>Everywhere the blood ran streaming,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the keen-edged swords were reddened</div>
      <div class='line'>As we hewed among the heathen.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>We have had our fill of slaughter,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round us lie the heaps of corpses;</div>
      <div class='line'>Gory swords have been red-painting</div>
      <div class='line'>At the Drómund all this morning;</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon the news will spread to northward</div>
      <div class='line'>Of this furious sword-tempest;</div>
      <div class='line'>It will soon be known at Verbon,</div>
      <div class='line'>How we dealt death-blows this morning.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>There was much talk about what had been done; every one
told what he had seen. Then they talked of who had been
the first to board, but were not all of one opinion. Some
said it would not be creditable to them if they did not all
relate this great exploit in the same way. At last they
all agreed to let Earl Rögnvald decide, and every one should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>afterwards tell the story in the same way as he did. Then
the Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Audun Raudi was the man who</div>
      <div class='line'>First, with energy and valour,</div>
      <div class='line'>Scaled the black sides of the Drómund;</div>
      <div class='line'>Soon the brave one seized his booty.</div>
      <div class='line'>By the help of God’s good favour</div>
      <div class='line'>Have we overcome the heathen;</div>
      <div class='line'>Steeped our swords are all in red blood;</div>
      <div class='line'>Round us lie the sable corpses.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>When they had cleared the Drómund, they set it on fire.
When the big man whom they had taken prisoner saw this,
he changed colour and became pale, and could not keep
himself still. But though they tried to make him speak,
he did not say a word, neither did he make any kind of
sign; he was immovable to fair promises and menaces
alike. But when the Drómund began to blaze up, they
saw a glowing stream, as it were, run into the sea. At this
the captive man was greatly moved. They concluded that
they had not made a careful search for the money, and now
the metal, whether gold or silver, had melted in the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Earl Rögnvald and his men sailed south, under
Serkland, and lay off a certain town of Serkland, and had
seven nights’ truce with the men of the town, and sold
them silver and other valuables. No one would buy the
big man; and then the Earl gave him leave to go away
with four men. He came back on the morning after, with
his men, and told them that he was a nobleman of Serkland,
and that he had been ransomed from there with the
Drómund and all its contents. “It grieved me most,” he
said, “that you should burn it, and thus destroy so much
treasure, without any one’s having the benefit of it. Now
you are in my power, but it counts for your benefit with
me that you spared my life, and did me such honour as you
could. But I would gladly never see you again, and now
may you live hale and well.” Then he rode away into the
country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald sailed to Crete, and anchored in a strong
gale. When Armod kept watch during the night, he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Lie we now, where stormy billows</div>
      <div class='line'>Break above the sturdy bulwarks;</div>
      <div class='line'>My lot is to keep the watch well,</div>
      <div class='line'>On this wave-surmounting seahorse;</div>
      <div class='line'>While the lads are snugly sleeping,</div>
      <div class='line'>I, to Crete, look o’er my shoulder.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>They lay off Crete until they had fair wind to Jórsalir
(Jerusalem), and arrived early on a Friday morning at
Akursborg (Acre). They went on shore with great pomp
and splendour, such as seldom had been seen there. Thorbiörn
Svarti sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oft have I, with comrades hardy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Been in battle, in the Orkneys,</div>
      <div class='line'>When the feeder of the people</div>
      <div class='line'>Led his forces to the combat.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now our trusty Earl we follow,</div>
      <div class='line'>As we carry up our bucklers</div>
      <div class='line'>Gaily to the gates of Acre</div>
      <div class='line'>On this joyful Friday morning.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>They stayed in Akursborg for a while, and a disease
broke out among their men, of which many died. Thorbiörn
Svarti died there.  Oddi Litli sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Bravely bore the Baron’s vessels</div>
      <div class='line'>Thorbiörn Svarti, scald and comrade,</div>
      <div class='line'>As he trod the sea-king’s highway,</div>
      <div class='line'>Round by Thrasness, south to Acre.</div>
      <div class='line'>There I saw them heap the grave-mould</div>
      <div class='line'>Of the High Church o’er the King’s friend.</div>
      <div class='line'>Earth and stones now lies he under</div>
      <div class='line'>In that southern land of sunshine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Earl Rögnvald and his men left Akursborg, and visited
all the holiest places of Jorsalaland. They went all to
Jordan and bathed. Earl Rögnvald and Sigmund Ongul
swam across the river, and went to some shrubs and tied
large knots.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c017'><sup>[382]</sup></a> The Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Long the way is I have travelled</div>

      <div class='line'>And the wise maid will remember,</div>
      <div class='line'>Too, my crossing over Jordan.</div>
      <div class='line'>Seems to me, that those who tarry</div>
      <div class='line'>At their homesteads, will not find it</div>
      <div class='line'>A short journey here to travel.</div>
      <div class='line'>Warm the blood falls on the wide plain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then Sigmund sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This day I have tied a strong knot</div>
      <div class='line'>For the churlish clown that’s sitting</div>
      <div class='line'>By the home-hearth; ’tis no falsehood</div>
      <div class='line'>That we play him now a fine trick.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Earl sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>On this feast-day of St. Lawrence,</div>
      <div class='line'>Tie we knots for this fine fellow.</div>
      <div class='line'>Tired I came to this nice corner,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the shrubs grow close together.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>And when they were going from Jorsalaland Earl Rögnvald
sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From the scald’s neck hangs the cross now,</div>
      <div class='line'>In his hand a palm he carries.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now should cease unkindly feelings:</div>
      <div class='line'>From the heights my men rush downwards.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>During the summer Earl Rögnvald and his men left
Jorsalaland, and were going to Mikligard. In the autumn
they came to a town called Imbolum,<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c017'><sup>[383]</sup></a> and stayed there a
long time. When two persons met where the street was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>crowded, and one of them thought it necessary to go to one
side, he cried out to the other, “Midway, midway!” One
evening the Earl’s men, among whom was Erling Skakki,
walked from the town, and on the bridge leading to the
ship, some inhabitants of the town met them, and cried
out, “Midway, midway!” Erling was very drunk, and pretended
not to hear it; and when they met, he jumped from
the bridge into the mud; his men ran to his assistance, and
dragged him out, and had to undress him completely. Next
morning, when the Earl saw him, and was told what had
happened, he smiled and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Bad the luck my friend has met with;</div>
      <div class='line'>In the mud he tumbled, splashing;</div>
      <div class='line'>As he would not cry out “Midway!”</div>
      <div class='line'>Loudly, like the foreign people.</div>
      <div class='line'>I suppose the prince’s brother,</div>
      <div class='line'>When upset, looked rather rueful.</div>
      <div class='line'>Black the mud that on the ground is</div>
      <div class='line'>In Imbol, as Erling knoweth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Some time after, it happened that they came from the
town very drunk, and Jón Fót was missed by his men,
and no one else was missing. They sent immediately to
the other ships to search for him, but he was not found.
They could not search for him on shore during the night;
but in the morning, when it was daylight, they found him
murdered under the wall of the town; but it was never
known who had slain him. They buried him honourably
at a holy church, and then they went away, and came north
to Ægisness,<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c017'><sup>[384]</sup></a> and there they waited some nights for a fair
wind to sail to Mikligard. They made their ships look
splendidly, and sailed with great pomp, as they knew Sigurd

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL RÖGNVALD.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Rögnvald</span> and his men came to Mikligard, and were well
received by the Emperor and the Væringiar.<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c017'><sup>[385]</sup></a> At this time
Menelaus, whom we call Manuli,<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c017'><sup>[386]</sup></a> was the Emperor of Mikligard.
He gave them a great deal of money, and offered
them pay if they would stay there permanently. They
spent there a great part of the winter. Eindridi Ungi was
there when they came, and was highly honoured by the
Emperor. He had little to do with the Earl and his
men, but rather spoke slightingly of them to others. Rögnvald
commenced his journey from Mikligard during the
winter, and went first to Dýraksborg<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c017'><sup>[387]</sup></a> in Bólgaraland.
From there they sailed west to Púll.<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c017'><sup>[388]</sup></a> Earl Rögnvald,
Erling, Bishop William, and most others of their noblest
men left their ships there, procured horses, and rode first
to Rómaborg (Rome), and then from Róm until they came
to Denmark. From there they went to Norway, where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>people were glad to see them. This journey became very
famous, and all those who had made it were considered
greater men afterwards than before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ogmund Dreng, Erling Skakki’s brother, had died while
they were away; while both were alive, he was considered
the greater of the two. After the death of King Ingi,
Magnus, the son of Erling and Kristín, the daughter of
Sigurd Jorsalafari, was made King, but the government of
Norway was in the hands of Erling alone. Valdimar,
King of the Danes, gave him the title of Earl, and he
became a great chief. Eindridi came from the south some
winters after Earl Rögnvald, and went to King Eystein,
because he would not have anything to do with Erling.
But after King Eystein’s death Eindridi and Sigurd, the
son of Hávard Höld of Reyr, raised a party, and made
Hákon Herdabreid,<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c017'><sup>[389]</sup></a> the son of King Sigurd, son of Harald
Gilli, their king. They slew Gregorius Dag’s son and
King Ingi. Eindridi and Hákon fought with Erling, under
Sekkr,<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c017'><sup>[390]</sup></a> where Hákon was killed; but Eindridi fled. Earl
Erling had Eindridi Ungi killed some time after in Vik.<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c017'><sup>[391]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald spent the summer in Hördaland, in
Norway, and heard many tidings from the Orkneys. There
were great disturbances there, and most of the chiefs were
divided into two factions, few remaining neutral. Earl
Harald was at the head of one of these factions, and Earl
Erlend and Swein, Asleif’s son, of the other. When the
Earl heard this, he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Though the most part of my nobles</div>
      <div class='line'>Have forgot the oaths they sware me</div>
      <div class='line'>(Such the wickedness of men is),</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet will their designs be thwarted.</div>
      <div class='line'>Traitors plotting in my absence,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will not by it grow more loyal;</div>
      <div class='line'>Slow but sure shall be my motto</div>
      <div class='line'>While a beard on chin I carry.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The Earl had no ships, but he asked his kinsmen and
friends to build some long-ships for him during the winter.
They gave a favourable answer, and consented to everything
he proposed, and built the ships.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL RÖGNVALD GOES TO THE ORKNEYS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>In</span> the summer the Earl made himself ready to go west to
his dominions in the Orkneys, but it was late before he was
ready, because many things kept him back. He went to
the west in a merchant-vessel belonging to Thórhall, Asgrím’s
son, an Icelander of a noble family, who had a farm south in
Biskupstungur.<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c017'><sup>[392]</sup></a> The Earl had a numerous train of noblemen
on board the vessel. When they came to Scotland
the winter was far advanced, and they lay at Torfnes.<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c017'><sup>[393]</sup></a> The
Earl arrived in his dominions shortly before Yule.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>KING EYSTEIN TAKES EARL HARALD PRISONER.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> we have to tell what happened in the Orkneys while
Earl Rögnvald was away. The same summer that the Earl
went on his journey, King Eystein, son of Harald Gilli,
arrived from Norway with a numerous army, which he had
landed at Rínarsey.<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c017'><sup>[394]</sup></a> He heard that Earl Harald had gone
over to Caithness in a ship of twenty benches, with eighty
men, and lay then at Thórsá. When King Eystein heard of
him, he manned three boats, and crossed the Pentland Firth,
going westward, and on to Thórsá. When he arrived there
the Earl and his men did not know anything of them until
the King’s men boarded the ship, and took the Earl prisoner.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>He was brought before the King, and the result
was that the Earl ransomed himself with three marks of
gold, and surrendered his dominions to King Eystein, so
that he should hold them from him in the future. Then
he became King Eystein’s man, and confirmed their compact
with oaths. From there King Eystein went to Scotland,
and ravaged there during the summer. During this
expedition he plundered in many parts of England, considering
that he was taking revenge for King Harald,
Sigurd’s son.<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c017'><sup>[395]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF KING EYSTEIN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Then</span> King Eystein returned to his kingdom, and his expedition
was variously thought of. Earl Harald remained
in his dominions in the Orkneys, and most of the inhabitants
were satisfied with his rule. At this time his father, Earl
Maddad, was dead; but his mother, Margarét, had gone to
the Orkneys. She was a handsome woman,<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c017'><sup>[396]</sup></a> but a virago.
At this time David, the King of Scots, died, and his son
Malcolm<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c017'><sup>[397]</sup></a> was made king. He was quite a child when he
succeeded his father.</p>
<h3 id='ch-lxxxvii' class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXVII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL HARALD.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Erlend</span>, the son of Harald Sléttmáli, spent most of his time
in Thórsá. Sometimes he was in the Sudreyar, or on war
expeditions, after the death of Earl Ottar. He was a very
promising man, and accomplished in most things, liberal in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>money, gentle, open to advice, and greatly loved by his men.
He had a large following.</p>
<p class='c008'>There was a man named Anakol, who had fostered
Erlend, and to his counsels he chiefly listened. He was of
a noble family, and hardy. He was Earl Erlend’s right-hand
man.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Earl Rögnvald had left his dominions to go to
Jórsalaheim, Erlend went to Malcolm,<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c017'><sup>[398]</sup></a> the King of Scots,
and requested him to give him an Earl’s title, and Caithness
for his support, as his father Earl Erlend had. And because
Erlend had many friends, and Malcolm was a child in years,
it was brought about that he bestowed the title of Earl on
Erlend, and gave him the half of Caithness jointly with his
kinsman Harald. Then Erlend went to Caithness to see his
friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>After that he gathered troops together, went out to the
Orkneys, and sought to be accepted by the inhabitants.
When Earl Harald, Maddad’s son, heard this, he gathered troops
together, and had many men. Some parties went between the
kinsmen and tried to make peace between them. Erlend asked
for half of the Islands jointly with Earl Harald, but Earl
Harald refused to give them up. Truce was, however, made
between them for that year; and it was resolved that Erlend
should go to the east and see the King of Norway, and ask
for that half which belonged to Earl Rögnvald, which Earl
Harald said he would surrender. Then Erlend went east to
Norway, but Anakol and some of his party remained behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gunni, Olaf’s son, the brother of Swein, Asleif’s son, had
children by Margarét, Earl Harald’s mother, but Earl Harald
had banished him, and therefore enmity arose between him
and Swein. The latter sent his brother Gunni south to
Liódhús (Lewis) to his friend Liótólf, with whom he had been
staying himself. Fugl, the son of Liótólf, was with Earl
Harald, and there was therefore coldness between him and
Swein. When Earl Erlend went east to Norway, Earl
Harald went over to Caithness, and resided at Vík (Wick)
during the winter. Swein, Asleif’s son, was then at Thrasvík
(Freswick), in Caithness, and took care of the estate which
his stepsons had there, for his former wife was Ragnhild,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Ingimund’s daughter, though they lived but a short time
together. Their son was Olaf. After that he married
Ingirid, Thorkel’s daughter. Their son was Andreas.</p>

<p class='c008'>On Wednesday in Passion week Swein went with some
others to Lambaborg. They saw a transport vessel coming
from the north across the Pentland Firth, and Swein concluded
that they were Earl Harald’s men whom he had
sent to collect his revenues (scat) in Hjaltland. Swein
ordered his men to take a boat and attack the barge, which
they did. They seized all its cargo, and put Earl Harald’s
men on shore, and they went to Vík (Wick) and told him.
Earl Harald did not say much to this, yet he said: “Swein
and I shall have our turns.” He distributed his men to be
entertained during Easter. The Caithnessmen called this—that
the Earl was in guest-quarters.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXVIII.<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Immediately</span> after Easter week, Swein, Asleif’s son, went
with a barge and a boat rowed by oars to the Orkneys; and
when they came to Skálpeid (Scapa), they took there a ship
from Fugl, Liótólf’s son. He was coming from his father at
Liódhús (Lewis), and was going to Earl Harald. During the
same trip they took twelve ounces of gold from Sigurd Klaufi,
a housecarl of Earl Harald’s. This money had been left at
the homestead, but the owners were in Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall).
Then Swein went over to Ness (Caithness), and up
through Scotland. He found Malcolm,<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c017'><sup>[399]</sup></a> King of Scots, who
was then nine winters old, in Apardion (Aberdeen). Swein
spent a month there, and was well entertained. The King
of Scots insisted upon his enjoying all those emoluments
of Caithness which he had before he became Earl Harald’s
enemy.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER LXXXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF SWEIN AND ANAKOL.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> this Swein prepared to go away, and the King of
Scots and he parted very good friends. Then Swein went
to his ships, and sailed from the south to the Orkneys.
Anakol was at Dýrness when Swein sailed from the south,
and they saw them sailing east off Múli.<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c017'><sup>[400]</sup></a> They sent Gauti,
a bondi of Skeggbjarnarstadir,<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c017'><sup>[401]</sup></a> to Swein, and Anakol requested
him to come to terms with Fugl about the seizure of the
ship, because Anakol and Fugl were related to each other.
When Gauti found Swein, and told him Anakol’s message,
he sent a messenger back to Anakol, asking him to go to
Sandey, that they might meet there, because he (Swein) had
to be there himself. They had a peaceful meeting there,
and came to terms; and the result was that Swein should
make the award as he liked himself. After that Anakol
formed an alliance with Swein, and bound himself to make
peace between Swein and Earl Erlend, when he came from
the east—for they were bitter enemies on account of the
burning of Frákork. Swein and Anakol went to Striónsey,
and lay off Hofsness<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c017'><sup>[402]</sup></a> some nights. At this time Thorfinn
Bessason lived at Striónsey. His wife was Ingigerd, Swein’s
sister, who had been deserted by Thorbiörn Klerk.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XC<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE RECONCILIATION OF EARL ERLEND AND SWEIN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Swein and Anakol were lying off Hofsness, Earl
Erlend arrived there from Norway. Anakol and Thorfinn
endeavoured to reconcile him to Swein, but he gave an
unfavourable answer, saying that Swein had always been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>opposed to his kinsmen, and had not kept the agreement
between him and Earl Ottar, that he should help him to the
dominion. Then Swein offered the Earl his support, and
they were negotiating the whole day; yet the Earl would
not be reconciled until Anakol and Thorfinn declared that
they would follow Swein from Orkney if the Earl would not
make peace with him. Earl Erlend then told the message
from King Eystein, that he should have that part of the
Orkneys which had formerly been held by Earl Harald.</p>
<p class='c008'>When they had made peace, Swein gave the advice that
they should go to Earl Harald before he heard this from
others, and ask him to surrender the dominion. Swein’s
advice was acted upon. They found Earl Harald on board
his ship, off Kjárekstadir.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c017'><sup>[403]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>It was in the evening of Michaelsmas that Harald
and his men saw long-ships approaching, and suspecting
them to be enemies, they ran from the ships into the castle.
There was a man named Arni, Rafn’s son, who ran from
Earl Harald’s ship to Kirkiuvag. He was so frightened
that he forgot that he had his shield at his shoulder until it
stuck fast in the door. Earl Erlend and Swein ran from
their ships, and pursued Earl Harald to the castle, and
attacked them both with arms and fire. The assailed
defended themselves bravely, until night parted them.
Many were wounded on both sides, and Harald and his
men would soon have been exhausted if the attack had
lasted longer. The next morning the Bœndr and their
mutual friends arrived, and tried to make peace between
them. Earl Erlend and Swein were very reluctant to make
peace. In the end, however, they agreed, on condition that
Harald should swear to let Earl Erlend have his part of the
Islands, and never demand it from him. These oaths were
made in the presence of the best men in the Islands.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>After that Earl Harald went over to Ness (Caithness),
and to his friends in Scotland, accompanied by only a few
men from the Orkneys.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Erlend and Swein called together a Thing-meeting
with the Bœndr in Kirkiuvag, and they arrived from all the
Islands. Earl Erlend pleaded his cause, saying that King
Eystein had given him that part of the Orkneys of which
Earl Harald had charge, and he requested the Bœndr to
receive him, showing them King Eystein’s letters, which
proved his words. Swein, and many others of his friends
and kinsmen, spoke in favour of the Earl; and at last the
Bœndr promised obedience to Earl Erlend. Then he took
possession of all the islands, and became ruler over them.
It was an agreement between Earl Erlend and the Bœndr
that he should not hinder Earl Rögnvald from taking possession
of that part of the islands which belonged to him, if it
should be granted him to come back; but if Earl Rögnvald
should demand more than one-half of the islands, they should
help Earl Erlend to resist his claims. Swein, Asleif’s son,
was frequently with Earl Erlend, and asked him to be on his
guard, and not to trust Earl Harald or the Scots. The most
part of the winter they were on board their ships, and had
scouts on the look-out. Towards Yule-tide the weather
began to grow boisterous, and Swein went home to his estate
in Gáreksey, and asked the Earl not to relax his vigilance
though they parted, and the Earl did so. He remained on
board his ships, and had nowhere a Yule feast prepared for
him in the Islands.</p>
<h3 id='ch-xci' class='c001'>CHAPTER XCI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL HARALD COMES UNPERCEIVED TO THE ORKNEYS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The</span> eleventh day of Yule-tide, it happened in Gáreksey that
Swein was sitting at his drink with his men. Rubbing his
nose, he said: “I think Earl Harald is now on his way to
the Islands.”</p>
<p class='c008'>His men replied that this was unlikely, on account of
the strong gales prevailing at that time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>He replied: “I know such is your opinion, and I shall
not therefore send intelligence to the Earl now, merely on
the strength of my presentiment; yet I suspect it is necessary.”
Then the subject was dropped, and they went on
drinking as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Harald commenced his voyage to the Orkneys during
Yule-tide. He had four ships, and a hundred men. Two
nights he lay under Gáreksey (Grimsey?). They landed in
Hafnarvag,<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c017'><sup>[404]</sup></a> in Hrossey, and the thirteenth day of Yule-tide
they walked to Fiörd (Firth). They spent the Yule-holiday
at Orkahaug.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c017'><sup>[405]</sup></a> There two of their men were seized with madness,
which retarded their journey. It was near day when
they came to Fiörd (Firth). There they learned that Earl
Erlend was on board his ship, but that he had been drinking
during that day at a house on shore. There Harald and his
men killed two men—one was named Ketill, the name of
the other is not mentioned—and made four prisoners: Arnfinn,
Anakol’s brother, another man called Liótólf, and two
others. Harald and Thorbiörn Klerk returned to Thórsá;
the brothers Benedict and Eirík went to Lambaborg, taking
Arnfinn with them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>As soon as Earl Erlend became aware of the enemy,
he sent men during the night to Gáreksey to tell Swein.
He pushed out his boats immediately, and went to see Earl
Erlend, according to the message, and they stayed on board
the ships a great part of the winter. Benedict and his
brother sent word that Arnfinn would not be liberated unless
Earl Erlend sent them back their ship which had been seized
off Kjárekstadir. The Earl was willing to give up the ship,
but Anakol dissuaded him from it, saying that Arnfinn would
get away without this sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the Wednesday before Lent, Anakol and Thorstein,
Ragna’s son, went over by night to Ness (Caithness) in
a boat with twenty men. They hauled the boat ashore
under a cliff in a hidden creek. Then they went up and hid
themselves in some copsewood a short distance from Thrasvík
(Freswick). They had fitted up the boat in such a way that
the men seemed to be each in his place. Some men had
come past the boat in the morning, and had not suspected
anything.</p>

<p class='c008'>Anakol and his men saw some men rowing from the
borg<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c017'><sup>[406]</sup></a> and landing at the river-mouth.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c017'><sup>[407]</sup></a> Then they saw a
man riding from the borg, and another walking, whom they
recognised to be Eirík. Then they divided themselves into
two parties. Ten went along the river down to the sea, to
prevent them from getting to the boat; other ten went to
the hamlet. Eirík came a short time before them to the
hamlet, and walked towards the drinking-hall. Then he
heard armed men moving about, and ran into the hall, and
out through another door, and down to his boat; but there he
came upon men who seized him, and brought him out to the
Islands to Earl Erlend. Then messengers were sent to Earl
Harald to tell him that Eirík would not be liberated until
Arnfinn and his companions came safe to Erlend. And the
wishes of both were complied with.</p>

  <h3 id='ch-xcii' class='c001'>CHAPTER XCII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE RECONCILIATION OF THE EARLS HARALD AND ERLEND.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>In</span> the spring Earl Harald prepared to go from Caithness
north to Hjaltland. His intention was to take the life of
Erlend Ungi, who had wooed his mother Margarét, although
the Earl (Harald) had refused him. Then Erlend gathered
men together, and carried her off from the Orkneys, and took
her north to Hjaltland, took up his residence in Moseyarborg,<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c017'><sup>[408]</sup></a>
and made great preparations (for defence). When the Earl
(Harald) came to Hjaltland, he besieged the borg, and cut off
all communication; but it was difficult to take it by assault,
and men went between them and tried to reconcile them.
Erlend asked the Earl to give him the woman in marriage,
and in return he offered to assist the Earl, saying it was of
greater consequence for him to recover his dominions than
this, and it would be advisable for him to make as many
friends as he could. Many spoke in favour of Erlend’s proposal;
and the result was that they made peace, and Erlend
married Margarét. Then he became an ally of Earl Harald,
and during the summer they both went east to Norway.</p>

<p class='c008'>When these tidings came to Orkney, Earl Erlend and his
men laid their plans. Swein counselled to go on a harrying
raid to obtain booty. This they did, and went south to
Breidafiord,<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c017'><sup>[409]</sup></a> and made inroads on the east of Scotland.
They went south to Beruvík (Berwick-on-Tweed). There
was a man named Knút the wealthy, who was a merchant,
and always resided in Beruvík. Swein and Erlend seized a
large and fine vessel belonging to Knút. On board was a
valuable cargo, and Knút’s wife. Then they sailed south to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Bl['y]hólmar.<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c017'><sup>[410]</sup></a> Knút was at Beruvík when he heard of the
plunder. He induced the Beruvík men for a hundred marks
of silver to try to recover the goods. Of those who went in
pursuit most were merchants. They went in fourteen ships
to search for them. When Earl Erlend and Swein were
lying under Bl['y]hólmar, Swein said in the night that they
should sleep without awnings, saying that he expected that
the Beruvík men might come upon them during the night in
great numbers. A gale was blowing, and no heed was paid
to Swein’s words, and they slept under the awnings, except
in Swein’s ship, where there was no awning abaft the mast.
Swein was sitting on a chest in a fur coat, saying that he
wished to be ready during the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of Swein’s crew was called Einar Skeif. He said
that Swein’s bravery was much talked of, that he was called
a bolder man than others, but now he dared not have awnings
on board his ship. Watchmen were on shore in the
island. Swein, hearing that they did not agree about what
they saw, went up to them and asked what they were disputing
about? They said they were not sure what it was
that they saw. Swein had keener sight than any of his
men, and when he looked he saw fourteen ships approaching
them from the north. Then he went on board his ship
again, and told his men to wake up and take down the awnings,
and then a great outcry arose, every one asking Swein
what they should do. He told them to be silent, and said
that his advice was to moor the ships between the island
and the mainland, adding: “We shall see whether they do
not pass by us, and if they do we shall part; but if they
attack us, we shall row against them as vigorously as possible,
and let us make a stout resistance if we meet.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Others spoke against this plan, saying the only way was
to sail from them, and so they did.</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein said: “If you wish to sail away, then stand out
to sea.” Swein was not so soon ready as the others, but
Anakol waited for him. Swein’s ship was, however, a
swifter sailer, and he took in sail and waited for Anakol,
not wishing him to be left behind in a single ship. When
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>they stood off, with all sail set, Einar Skeif said: “Swein,
does our ship stand still?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein replied: “I do not think so; but I advise you
not to question my courage any more, since through your
fright you cannot tell whether the ship moves or stands still,
yet it is one of the swiftest sailers.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They put in under Mosey,<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c017'><sup>[411]</sup></a> and Swein sent men to
Eidinaborg to tell the King of Scots of his plunder; but
before they came to the town they met twelve men on horseback
who had saddle-bags filled with silver, and when they
met they inquired after Swein, Asleif’s son. The others told
where he was, and asked what they wanted with him. The
Scots said they had been told that Swein was taken prisoner,
and the King of Scots had sent them to ransom him. Thus
they told their errand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The King did not make much of Knút’s loss, but sent a
costly shield to Swein, and other presents besides.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Erlend and Swein arrived rather late in the Orkneys
in the autumn. This summer Earl Harald went east to Norway.
At the same time, Earl Rögnvald and Erling Skakki
came to Norway from Mikligard, and he arrived at his
dominions in the Orkneys shortly before Yule.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XCIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>PEACE BETWEEN EARL RÖGNVALD AND EARL ERLEND.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Then</span> there went men immediately between Earl Erlend and
Earl Rögnvald, and tried to make peace between them, the
Bœndr pleading the agreement they had come to with Earl
Erlend, that he should not prevent Earl Rögnvald from
taking possession of his part of the Islands. A conference
took place between the Earls at Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall), and
at that conference they confirmed their peace with oaths.
It was two nights before Yule when they made peace, and
the terms were, that they should each have one-half of the
Islands, and both should defend them against Earl Harald
or any other if he claimed them. Earl Rögnvald had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>ships till his own came from the east in the summer. This
winter all was quiet, but in the spring the Earls prepared
their plans in case Earl Harald should come from the east.
Earl Erlend went to Hjaltland to intercept him if he should
come there. Earl Rögnvald went over to Thórsá, because
Earl Harald was expected to go there if he came from the
east, as he had there many friends and kinsmen. Earl
Erlend and Swein were in Hjaltland during the summer,
and kept back all ships, so that none went to Norway.</p>
<p class='c008'>In summer Earl Harald left Norway with seven ships,
and landed in the Orkneys. Three of the ships, however,
were driven by stress of weather to Hjaltland, and these
were seized by Swein and Earl Erlend. When Earl Harald
came to the Orkneys he heard of the agreement of Earl Rögnvald
and Earl Erlend, that each of them should have one-half
of the Islands; and then he saw that no territory was
intended for him. He resolved to go over to Ness (Caithness)
to Earl Rögnvald before Earl Erlend and Swein came
from the east. They were in Hjaltland, when they heard
that Earl Harald had arrived in the Orkneys with five
long-ships, and prepared to go thither immediately. In
Dynröst<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c017'><sup>[412]</sup></a> they had strong currents and severe gales, and
there they parted. Swein was driven back to Fridarey
(Fair Isle), with twelve ships, and they thought the Earl
had perished. From Fridarey they went to Sandey, where
they found Earl Erlend with three ships. It was a joyful
meeting for them. Then they went to Hrossey (Mainland),
and inquired about Earl Harald’s movements.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XCIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>PEACE IS TALKED OF.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> it is to be told that Earl Harald came to Thórsá with
six ships. Earl Rögnvald was in Sutherland, at the wedding
of his daughter Ingirid, whom he married to Eirík Slagbrellir.
He heard immediately that Earl Harald had arrived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>at Thórsá, and rode from Beruvík<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c017'><sup>[413]</sup></a> to Thórsá, attended by
many men. Eirík was related to Earl Harald; and with
many others he tried to make peace between them, saying
that it was absurd for them to be at enmity, because of
their relationship, their up-bringing, and their long alliance.
At last matters came so far that a meeting was appointed,
and truce made. They should meet in a certain castle at
Thórsá,<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c017'><sup>[414]</sup></a> and talk together alone; but an equal number of
their men should be outside the castle. They talked a
long time, and agreed very well. They had not seen each
other since Rögnvald returned. Late in the day information
was given to Earl Rögnvald that Earl Harald’s men
were coming there armed. Earl Harald said that no harm
would be done. Then they heard heavy blows outside, and
ran out. Thorbiörn Klerk had arrived there with a large
party, and attacked Rögnvald’s men immediately. The
Earls called to them that they should not fight. Then the
inhabitants of the town came running to the spot to separate
them. Thirteen of Earl Rögnvald’s men were killed, and
he himself was wounded in the face.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XCV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SWEIN’S PLANS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> this their friends made an effort to establish peace
between them, and the result was that they made peace,
which they confirmed by oaths. They renewed their alliance,
pledging their faith and shaking hands; and it was
resolved that they should go that very night out to the
Orkneys to attack Earl Erlend. They went out on the
Pentland Firth with ten ships, taking the course to Rínarsey.<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c017'><sup>[415]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>They landed in Vidivag,<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c017'><sup>[416]</sup></a> and went on shore. Erlend and
his men lay on board their ships in Bardvik,<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c017'><sup>[417]</sup></a> and from
there they saw a crowd on Rögnvaldsey, and sent out spies.
When they heard of the reconciliation of the Earls, it was
also said that Earl Erlend would not be permitted to plunder
on shore, or to obtain provisions in any other way; and
their intention was to prevent them from getting any food
in the island. Earl Erlend held a meeting and consulted
his men, and they agreed to leave it to Swein to say what
should be done. Swein replied that they should sail that
very night over to Caithness, saying that they had no
strength to contend with both the Earls there in the
Islands. He gave out that they intended to go to the
Sudreyar (Hebrides), and winter there.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was Michaelmas-eve when they sailed out on the
Firth, but when they came over to Ness (Caithness), they
ran up into the country, and drove down a great number of
cattle, which they brought on board their ships. There
were strong currents and bad weather, so that the Firth was
frequently impassable; but when favourable weather came,
Swein sent a man in a boat from Ness, to give information
that Earl Erlend had made a great strand-hewing<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c017'><sup>[418]</sup></a> in
Caithness, and was ready to sail to the Sudreyar when there
was a favourable wind. When this came to the ears of
Earl Rögnvald, he called his men together and made a
speech to them, telling them to be on their guard, to be
wary, and sleep every night on board their ships; “For
now,” he said, “Swein may be expected every hour in the
Islands; the more certainly the more he talks of going
away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Early in the winter Earl Erlend and Swein left Thórsá,
and took their course by the west of Scotland. They had
six large long-ships, all well manned. They had to row,
and when they had gone some distance from Caithness, Earl
Rögnvald’s spies went out to the Islands, and told him the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>news. Then the Earls moved their ships to Skálpeid
(Scapa), and Earl Rögnvald wished them to stay a while on
board.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Swein and Erlend came west off Staur,<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c017'><sup>[419]</sup></a> the
former said that they should not distress themselves by
rowing any farther, and asked his men to put the ships
about and set the sails. This action on the part of Swein
was thought foolish, yet his men did as he desired them.
When they had been sailing for a while the ships began
to speed, because there was a fine breeze, and nothing is said
of their voyage until they came to Vagaland,<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c017'><sup>[420]</sup></a> in Orkney.
There they heard that the Earls were lying at Skálpeid,
off Knarrarstadir,<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c017'><sup>[421]</sup></a> with thirteen ships. There were Erlend
Ungi, Eirík Slagbrellir, and many other men of note. Thorbiörn
Klerk had gone out to Papuley,<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c017'><sup>[422]</sup></a> to Hákon Karl,
his brother-in-law. It was four nights before Simon’s-mas
when Swein, Asleif’s son, decided to attack the Earls during
the night, but it was thought rather hazardous, as their
followers were so much more numerous. Yet Swein insisted
on having his own way; and so he did, because the
Earl wished to follow his advice.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XCVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>BATTLE BETWEEN THE THREE EARLS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>During</span> the night there fell a shower of sleet, and Earl
Rögnvald left his ship with six men, intending to go to his
residence at Jórfiara (Orphir), because he expected no danger.
During the shower they came to Knarrarstadir. An Icelander,
by name Bótólf Begla, an excellent skald, lived there.
He pressed Earl Rögnvald with many invitations to stay
there during the night. Earl Rögnvald and his men entered
the house; their clothes were pulled off them, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>went to sleep; but Bótólf was to keep watch. This same
night Earl Erlend and Swein attacked Earl Harald and his
men, and took them by surprise, and they knew of nothing
till they heard the battle-cry. They flew to arms, and
defended themselves bravely. Many were killed, and the
attack ended in this way—that Earl Harald leaped on shore
when there were only five men left in his ship. Bjarni,
brother of Erlend Ungi, a noble man, fell there, and a hundred
men with him; and a great number were wounded.
All the Earl’s men jumped from the ships to reach the
shore, and fled. Few of Earl Erlend’s men were killed, and
they took fourteen ships belonging to the Earls, with all
the valuables they contained. When the most part of their
work was done, they heard that Earl Rögnvald had left his
ship the evening before, and walked first to Knarrarstadir,
and thither they went. Bondi Bótólf was outside the door
when they came, and greeted them well. They asked
whether Earl Rögnvald was there. Bótólf said he had been
there during the night. They became very violent, and
demanded where the Earl was then, saying that he no
doubt knew where he was. He pointed with his hand
behind the farm-yard, and sang:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>This way went the Prince a-fowling;</div>
      <div class='line'>Skilful are his men with arrows.</div>

      <div class='line'>The Prince’s sword the land defendeth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>The Earl’s men ran away from the homestead, and he
who could run fastest considered himself luckiest, as he
would be the first to catch Earl Rögnvald. Bótólf went into
the house, awoke the Earl, and told him what had happened
during the night, and also what the Earl’s men were doing.
Rögnvald and his men started up instantly, and put on
their clothes; then they went away to the Earl’s residence at
Jórfiara; and when they came there they found Earl Harald
in hiding. The Earls [Harald and Rögnvald] went immediately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>over to Ness each in a separate boat; one had two
men, the other three. All their men went over to Ness,
wherever they could get a boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Erlend and Swein took the ships belonging to the
Earl, and a great quantity of other property. Swein took
for his share all Earl Rögnvald’s treasures that were in his
ship, and sent them to him over to Ness. Swein advised
Earl Erlend to move his ships out to Vagaland (Walls), and
to lie in the Firth, where they could see ships coming from
Ness, as he thought it would be convenient to run out upon
them if there was opportunity. But Earl Erlend yielded to
the persuasions of his men that they should go north to
Daminsey (Damsey), and in a large castle there they drank
all day, but fastened the ships together every night, and
slept on board. Thus time passed on till the Yule-feast.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XCVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>EARL ERLEND’S DEATH.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Five</span> nights before Christmas, Swein, Asleif’s son, went east
to Sandvik,<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c017'><sup>[423]</sup></a> to his kinswoman Sigríd, because he had to
make peace between her and her neighbour by name Björn.
Before he went away he told Earl Erlend to sleep on board
by night, and not to be less on his guard that he himself
was absent. Swein spent one night with his kinswoman
Sigríd. A tenant and dear friend of Sigríd’s, by name Gisl,
asked Swein to stay with him, as he had been brewing ale,
and wished to entertain him. When they came to Gisl
they were told that Earl Erlend had not gone on board that
night; and as soon as Swein heard it, he sent Margad,
Grim’s son, and two other men to the Earl, and asked him
to pay heed to his advice, although he had not done so the
preceding night, and then he added: “I suspect that I shall
not have long to provide for this Earl.”</p>
<p class='c008'>Margad and his companions found Earl Erlend, and
told him Swein’s words. The Earl’s men said: “He is a
strange man; sometimes he is afraid of nothing, at other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>times he is so frightened that he does not know where to
look for shelter to himself or others.” They said they
would sleep quietly on shore, and not go on board. The
Earl said they should do as Swein advised them, and he
went on board with four-and-twenty men; the others slept
at a house. Margad went to another creek, not far away.
This very night the Earls Rögnvald and Harald surprised
Earl Erlend, and neither the watchmen who kept guard on
the island nor those on board the ship perceived them until
they were climbing on board. A man named Orm and
another Ufi were in the forepart of the Earl’s ship. Ufi
jumped up and tried to rouse the Earl, but could not, for
he was dead-drunk. Then he took him in his arms, and
jumped overboard with him into a boat alongside the ship,
and Orm jumped overboard on the other side, and escaped
on shore. There Earl Erlend was slain, and most of those
on board. Margad and his men were awakened during the
night by the battle-cry, and took to their oars, and rowed
round the headland. It was clear moonlight, and they saw
when the Earls went away; and they felt sure that fate
had decided between them. They rowed away first to
Rennadal (Rendale), and sent men to Swein, Asleif’s son, to
tell him what they had seen. Earl Harald wished to give
Earl Erlend’s men peace, but Earl Rögnvald wished to wait,
in order to know whether the Earl’s body would be found
or not. The body was found two nights before Yule. A
spear was seen standing in a heap of seaweed; and that
spear was fast in Earl Erlend’s body.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c017'><sup>[424]</sup></a> Then it was brought
to church, and peace was given to the Earl’s men, as well
as to four of Swein’s men who had been taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>A man named Jón Vœng was a sister’s son of that Jón
Vœng who was mentioned before.<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c017'><sup>[425]</sup></a> He had been with
Hákon Karl, and had a child by his sister; then he ran
away, and was with Anakol on piratical expeditions; but
now he was with Erlend, yet he was not in the battle. All
Erlend’s men went to Kirkiuvag, and took refuge in St.
Magnus’s church. The Earls went there, and a meeting for
peace-making was held in the church. The Earls would not
pardon Jón until he promised to marry the woman. All
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the men swore oaths of fealty to the Earls, and Jón Vœng
became Earl Harald’s steward.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XCVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SWEIN SLAYS ERLEND.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> Earl Erlend’s death Swein, Asleif’s son, went to
Rennadal (Rendale), and there he saw Margad, who was
able to give him all the tidings of what happened in Daminsey.
Then Swein went to Hrólfsey (Rousay), and arrived
there at high-water. He and his men brought all the
tackle of the ships on shore, and placed it in safety. They
divided themselves among the farms, and kept watch on
the movements of the Earls and other chiefs. Swein,
Asleif’s son, mounted the hill with five men, and went
down to the sea on the other side; they hid themselves at
the homestead in the darkness, and heard a great talking.
There were Thorfinn, his son Ogmund, and their brother-in-law
Erlend.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c017'><sup>[426]</sup></a> He boasted of having given Earl Erlend the
death-blow, and all of them were declaring they had done
right well. When Swein heard this, he and his companions
went in upon them. Swein was quickest, and immediately
dealt Erlend a death-blow. They took Thorfinn prisoner,
and brought him away; but Ogmund was wounded. Swein
went to Thingavöll,<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c017'><sup>[427]</sup></a> to his father’s brother Helgi; and there
they spent the first days of Yule in hiding. Earl Rögnvald
went to Daminsey, but Earl Harald was at Kirkiuvag
during Yule-tide. Earl Rögnvald sent men to Thingavöll,
to Helgi, and asked him to tell his kinsman Swein, if he
knew anything of his whereabouts, that Earl Rögnvald invited
him to spend the Yule with him, and he would try to
make peace between him and Earl Harald. When Swein
received this message, he went to Earl Rögnvald, and remained
with him during the rest of the Yule-tide, and was
well treated.</p>

  <h3 id='ch-xcix' class='c001'>CHAPTER XCIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL HARALD AND SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> Christmas a meeting was appointed to make peace
between the Earls and Swein, when they should finally settle
all matters about which reconciliation had been made. When
they met, Earl Rögnvald took great pains to make peace between
them. Others, however, who were not Swein’s friends
or kinsmen, spoke against him, saying that he would always
be causing disturbances if he were not expelled from the
Islands. At last, however, they agreed upon this—that
Swein should pay a mark of gold to each of the Earls, and
should keep one-half of his estates and a good long-ship.</p>
<p class='c008'>When Swein heard the award, he replied: “Our agreement
will be good only in case I am not oppressed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald would not accept the payment from
Swein, saying that he would in no way oppress him, as he
considered his faithfulness and friendship worth more than
money.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the peace-meeting, Earl Harald went to Gáreksey,
and used Swein’s corn and other property rather wastefully.
When Swein heard this he complained of his loss to Earl
Rögnvald, and said, that “this was a breach of their agreement,
and that he would go home to look after his property.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald said: “Stay with me, Swein: I shall
send a message to Earl Harald, for he will be more than a
match for you to deal with, strong and brave as you are.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein was not to be dissuaded, and went with ten men
in a boat to Gáreksey, and arrived there late in the evening.
They went behind the houses, and Swein wished to set fire
to the hall, and burn down the homestead, and the Earl
within it. A man named Swein, Blákári’s son, the most
notable of Swein’s companions, dissuaded him from doing
so, saying that the Earl was not perhaps in the homestead;
and if he was there, he would neither permit Swein’s wife
nor his daughter to go out, and it was never to be thought
of to burn them. Then they went up to the door, and into
the entry. Those who were inside the hall jumped up and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>closed the door, and then Swein and his men became aware
that the Earl was not in the house. Those who were
within soon ceased resisting, surrendered their weapons to
Swein, and went out unarmed. Swein gave quarter to all
Earl Harald’s men. He poured out all his beer, and took
away his wife and daughter. He asked his wife Ingirid
where Earl Harald was, but she would not tell him. He
then said: “Say nothing then, but point to where he is.”
She would not do that either, because she was related to
the Earl. Swein gave up some of the arms, when they
came on board the ships. But the effect of this was that
their agreement of peace was at an end.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Harald had gone out to a certain island to hunt
hares.<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c017'><sup>[428]</sup></a> Swein went to Hellisey.<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c017'><sup>[429]</sup></a> It rises abruptly from
the sea, and there is a large cave in the cliffs, the mouth of
which is flooded at high-water. When the Earl’s men got
their weapons from Swein, they went to Earl Harald and
informed him of these doings of Swein’s. The Earl had his
ship set afloat, and ordered his men to row after him. He
said: “This time our meeting with Swein shall be decisive.”
Then they rowed in pursuit of him, and soon they saw and
recognised each other.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Swein saw that they gained on him, he said:
“We must devise some scheme, because I do not care to
meet the Earl with so great odds against me as I suspect
there are. Let us go to the cave and see how we fare.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Swein came to the cave it was ebb tide. They
hauled up the boat into the cave, which ran into the cliff,
and the water rose before the mouth of the cave. During
the day Earl Harald and his men searched for Swein
throughout the island, and did not find him, neither did they
see any boat leave the island. They wondered very much
at this, as they thought it unlikely that Swein’s boat had
gone down. They rowed round the island in search of the
boat, but did not find it. Then they concluded that he must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>have gone to some of the other islands, and they went where
they thought it most likely. It so happened that, when the
Earl rowed away, the tide was back from the mouth of the
cave. Swein had overheard the talk between the Earl and
his men. He left his own boat in the cave, and took a small
boat which the monks<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c017'><sup>[430]</sup></a> had, and went to Sandey. There they
landed, and pushed off the small boat, which drifted about
till it was wrecked. They came to a homestead called
Völuness,<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c017'><sup>[431]</sup></a> where a man lived by name Bárd, who was Swein’s
kinsman. They made themselves known to him secretly,
and Swein said he wished to stay there. Bárd said he
might do as he liked, but that he dared not keep him here
unless in hiding. They went in, and sat by themselves in
a part of the house separated from the other inmates by a
partition-wall. There was a secret door to it, filled up with
loose stones. That evening Jón Vœng, Earl Harald’s
steward, arrived there with six men, and Bárd received them
well. Large fires were made, at which they warmed themselves.
Jón was excited, and spoke of the dealings of Swein
and the Earls. He blamed Swein very much, said he was a
truce-breaker, and faithful to no one. He had lately made
peace with Earl Harald, and yet he went to attack him and
burn him in the house, adding that there would never be
peace in the land till Swein was banished from it. Bárd
and Jón’s companions put in some words in Swein’s defence.
Then Jón began to blame Earl Erlend, saying there was no
loss in his death, as he was a violent man, and nobody could
live in safety for him. When Swein heard this, he could
not restrain himself, but seized his weapons, and ran to the
secret door. He pushed the stones down, thus making a
great noise. Swein’s design was to leap before the hall-door.
Jón was sitting in his shirt and linen breeches, and when he
heard Swein coming he tied on his shoes and sprang out
from the fire and away from the house. The night was pitch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>dark, and it was hard frost. During the night he came to
another farm. His feet were very much frost-bitten, and
some of his toes fell off. Through the intercession of Bárd,
Swein gave peace to Jón’s companions. He remained there
during the night, but in the morning he and his men went
away in a boat belonging to Bárd, which he gave to him.
They went south to Bardsvík,<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c017'><sup>[432]</sup></a> and stayed in a certain cave.
Sometimes Swein took his meals at a house during the day,
but slept during the night down by his boat, and thus he
guarded himself against his enemies.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER C<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF ROGNVALD AND SWEIN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>One</span> morning early Swein and his men saw a large long-ship
coming from Hrólfsey (Hrossey?) to Rögnvaldsey,<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c017'><sup>[433]</sup></a> and Swein
recognised it immediately as Earl Rögnvald’s ship, which he
used to command himself. They put in at Rögnvaldsey,
where Swein’s boat was lying, and five of them went on
shore. Swein and his men were on a certain headland, and
threw stones at the Earl’s men. When those on board saw
this, they drew forth their arms; and when that was seen
by Swein, they ran down to the beach, and pushed their boat
afloat, and jumped into it. The long-ship stuck fast on the
beach. When they rowed past it, Swein was standing up
with a spear in his hand. When Earl Rögnvald perceived
it, he took a shield and held it before him, but Swein did
not throw the spear. When the Earl saw that they would
get away from them, he ordered a truce-shield to be held
aloft, and asked Swein to go on shore. When Swein saw
this, he told his men to put to land, saying that it was his
greatest satisfaction to be at peace with Earl Rögnvald.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL HARALD AND SWEIN.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Then</span> Earl Rögnvald and Swein went on shore, and had a
long conversation by themselves, and agreed very well.
While they were talking, they saw Earl Harald sailing from
Caithness to Vagaland (Walls), and when the ship approached
the island, Swein asked what was to be done. The Earl
said Swein should go over to Ness immediately. This was
during Lent. They left Rögnvaldsey at the same time.
The Earl went to Hrossey,<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c017'><sup>[434]</sup></a> but Swein went west to Straumsey
(Stroma). Earl Harald saw the boat, and thought he
recognised it as Swein’s, and went immediately into the
Firth in pursuit. When Swein saw the pursuit, they left
the boat, and hid themselves. When Earl Harald came to
Straumsey (Stroma) he saw the boat, and suspected that the
men were somewhere near, and would not therefore go on
shore. A man named Amundi, the son of Hnefi, who was
Earl Harald’s friend, and father’s brother to Swein, Asleif’s
son’s stepchildren, went between them, and succeeded so far
that they agreed to keep the agreement of peace which they
had made the previous winter. A gale arose, and they were
both obliged to remain there during the night, and Amundi
put Earl Harald and Swein in the same bed, and many of
their men slept in the same house.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this Swein went over to Ness (Caithness), and Earl
Harald to the Orkneys. Swein heard that the Earl had said
that their agreement to be at peace had been rather loose.
He paid little heed to this, however, and went south to
Dalir, and spent the Easter there with his friend Sumarlidi;
but Earl Harald went north to Hjaltland, and was there a
long time during the spring.</p>

<p class='c008'>After Easter Swein went from the south, and met on his
way two of Jón Vœng’s brothers—one was called Bunu-Pétr,
the other Blán. Swein and his men seized them, and took
from them all their goods, and brought them to land. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>gallows was erected for them, and when everything was ready
Swein said they should be allowed to run up the country,
adding that they were greater shame to their brother Jón
alive than dead. They were a long time out on the hills,
and when they came to some habitations they were very
much frost-bitten.</p>

<p class='c008'>From thence Swein went to Liódhús, in the Sudreyar,
and stayed there some time. When Jón Vœng heard that
Swein had taken his brothers prisoners, and not knowing
what he had done with them, he went to Eyin Helga (Enhallow),
and took Olaf, the son of Swein, Asleif’s son, and
Kolbein Hruga’s foster-son, and brought him to Westrey.
They met Earl Rögnvald at Hreppisnes,<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c017'><sup>[435]</sup></a> and when he saw
Olaf, he said: “Why are you here, Olaf?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He said: “It is the work of Jón Vœng.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl looked to Jón, and said: “Why did you bring
Olaf here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He replied: “Swein took my brothers, and I don’t know
but he may have killed them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said: “Take him back again as quickly as you
can, and do not dare to do him any harm, whatever may
have become of your brothers, for if you do, you will not be
safe in the Islands from either Swein or Kolbein.”</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL RÖGNVALD.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> Easter Swein commenced a journey to the Sudreyar,
taking with him sixty men. He went to the Orkneys, and
landed first in Hrólfsey (Rousay). There they took a man,
by name Hákon Karl,<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c017'><sup>[436]</sup></a> who had been with Earl Harald when
Earl Erlend was slain. Hákon ransomed himself with three
marks of gold, and thus saved himself from Swein. In
Hrólfsey Swein found the ship which the Earls had taken
from him, and two of the planks were cut, which had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>done by Earl Rögnvald’s order, because Swein had refused
to buy it or to accept it as a gift from the Earls. Swein
went from there to Hrossey, and met Earl Rögnvald at Birgishérad
(Birsay). The Earl received him well, and Swein
spent the spring with him. Earl Rögnvald said that he had
ordered the planks of the ship to be cut, because he did not
wish him to row about rashly among the Islands when he
came from the Sudreyar. Earl Harald came from Hjaltland
in the spring during the Whitsuntide, and when he came to
the Orkneys Earl Rögnvald sent men to him to say that he
wished the compact of peace between him and Swein to be
renewed, and a peace meeting was appointed in St. Magnus’s
church on Friday during the holy week. Earl Rögnvald
carried a broad axe to the meeting, and Swein went with
him. Then the peace compact which had been made in the
winter was confirmed.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Then</span> Earl Rögnvald gave Earl Harald the ship which had
belonged to Swein, but all other things which had been
awarded him from Swein he returned to him. Earl Rögnvald
and Swein were standing at the church-door while the
sail, which had been lying in St. Magnus’s church, was carried
out, and Swein looked rather gloomy. The following
Saturday, after noontide service, Earl Harald’s men came to
Swein, Asleif’s son, and said the Earl wished him to come
to speak with him. Swein consulted Earl Rögnvald, but he
did not say much in favour of his going, and added that one
did not know whom to trust. Swein went, nevertheless,
with five men. The Earl was sitting on a cross bench in a
small room, and Thorbiörn Klerk beside him. A few other
men were with the Earl, and they sat for a while and drank.
Then Thorbiörn left the room, and Swein’s companions said
to him that they distrusted the Earl’s conduct very much.
Thorbiörn returned shortly after, and presented Swein with a
scarlet tunic and a cloak, saying that he did not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>whether he would call it a gift, because these things had
been taken from Swein in the winter. Swein accepted the
gifts. Earl Harald restored to him the long-ship which had
belonged to him, and the half of his property and estates.
He asked him to stay with him, and said their friendship
should never be dissolved. Swein accepted all this gladly,
and went immediately the same night and told Earl Rögnvald
how matters had turned out between him and Earl
Harald. Earl Rögnvald said he was much pleased with
this, and told Swein to take care that they did not become
enemies again.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE EARLS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>A short</span> time after, the three chiefs—Swein, Thorbiörn, and
Eirik—went out on a plundering expedition. They went
first to the Sudreyar, and all along the west to the Syllingar,
where they gained a great victory in Maríuhöfn<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c017'><sup>[437]</sup></a> on Columba’s-mas
(9th June), and took much booty. Then they returned
to the Orkneys.</p>
<p class='c008'>When the Earls Harald and Rögnvald had made peace
with Swein, Asleif’s son, they were always together, and Earl
Rögnvald governed, but they agreed very well. When they
came home from the Syllingar, Thorbiörn Klerk went to Earl
Harald, and became his counsellor. Swein went home to
Gáreksey, and resided there during the winter with many
men, living upon his booty, and other stores which he possessed
there in the Islands. He was most attached to Earl
Rögnvald. Every summer he was out on marauding expeditions.
It was said that Thorbiörn did not improve the
harmony between Earl Harald and Earl Rögnvald.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thórarinn Killinef was one of Earl Rögnvald’s men, a
great friend of his, and was always with the Earl. A man
named Thorkel was one of Thorbiörn Klerk’s followers, and
a friend of his. Thórarinn and Thorkel quarrelled over
their drink at Kirkiuvag, and Thorkel wounded Thórarinn,
and then escaped to Thorbiörn. Thórarinn’s companions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>pursued Thorkel, but Thorbiörn and his men defended
themselves in a loft. The Earls were informed of this, and
they went to part them. Thorbiörn refused to leave the
decision of this case to Earl Rögnvald, as it was his men
that were concerned in the pursuit. When Thórarinn had
recovered from his wounds, he slew Thorkel as he was going
to church. He ran into the church, but Thorbiörn and his
men pursued him. Earl Rögnvald was told what was
happening, and he went there with his men, and asked
Thorbiörn whether he was going to break the church open.
Thorbiörn said the church ought not to shelter him who was
within. Earl Rögnvald said there should be no violation of
the church at this time, and Thorbiörn was pushed away
from it. No agreement was come to about this case.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorbiörn went over to Caithness, and was there for a
while. Then many things happened to estrange them, for
Thorbiörn was often guilty of violence to women, and of
manslaying. He went secretly out to the Orkneys in a
boat with thirty men, and landed at Skálpeid, and walked to
Kirkiuvag with three men. In the evening he went alone
into an inn where Thórarinn was drinking, and struck him a
death-blow immediately. Then he ran out into the darkness
and far away. For this the Earl made him an outlaw in
every part of his dominions. Thorbiörn went over to Ness,
and remained in hiding with his brother-in-law, Hösvir, who
was called the strong. He had married Thorbiörn’s sister,
Ragnhild, and their son was Stefán Rádgiafi (counsellor),
Thorbiörn’s follower. Shortly afterwards Thorbiörn went to
Malcolm, King of Scots, and remained there a while, in high
favour with the King. There was a man called Gillaodran
with the King of Scots. He was of a great family, but a
violent man. He had incurred the displeasure of the King
of Scots for violent acts and manslaughters which he had
committed in his kingdom. He fled to the Orkneys, and
the Earls received him. Then he went to Caithness, and
acted as a steward for the Earls. There was a noble Bondi
in Caithness, by name Helgi, a friend of Earl Rögnvald’s.
Gillaodran quarrelled with him about the stewardship, and
Gillaodran attacked and killed him. After the slaughter he
went west to Scotland’s Fiord, and was received by a chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>named Sumarlidi Höld,<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c017'><sup>[438]</sup></a> who had possessions in Dalir, on
Scotland’s Fiord. His wife was Ragnhild, the daughter of
Olaf Bitling (little bit), King of the Sudreyar. Their sons
were King Dufgall, Rögnvald, and Engull.<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c017'><sup>[439]</sup></a> They were called
the Dalverja family.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald sent for Swein, Asleif’s son, before he
went out on his expedition. When they met, Earl Rögnvald
asked him to have an eye on Gillaodran if he had an opportunity.
Swein said he did not know how far he might
succeed.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SWEIN SLAYS SUMARLIDI.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Then</span> Swein went on a marauding expedition, having five
long-ships. When he came west to Scotland’s Fiord, he
heard that Sumarlidi Höld had gone on board a ship, and
was about to set out on an expedition. He had seven ships,
and Gillaodran commanded one. He had gone into the
firths to bring up some troops that had not arrived. When
Swein heard of Sumarlidi, he gave him battle, and it was a
fierce fight. Sumarlidi Höld was killed in that fight, and
many men with him. When Swein became aware that
Gillaodran was not there, he went in search of him, and slew
him in Myrkvifiörd,<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c017'><sup>[440]</sup></a> and fifty men with him. Then he went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>on his expedition, and returned home in the autumn, as his
custom was. He went to see Earl Rögnvald soon after his
return, and he was much pleased with these deeds.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL RÖGNVALD AND EARL HARALD.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Every</span> summer the Earls were wont to go over to Caithness,
and up into the forests to hunt the red-deer or the reindeer.<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c017'><sup>[441]</sup></a>
Thorbiörn Klerk was with the King of Scots, and sometimes
he went to Caithness and stayed in hiding with his friends.
He had three friends in Caithness whom he trusted most.
One was his brother-in-law, Hösvir; the second, Liótólf, who
lived in Thórsdal; and the third was Hallvard, Dúfa’s son,
in Kálfadal (Calder), at a certain promontory off Thórsdal.
All these were his intimate friends.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SLAYING OF EARL RÖGNVALD.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Earl Rögnvald had been an Earl two-and-twenty
winters from the time that Earl Paul was taken prisoner, the
Earls went over to Caithness during the latter part of the
summer as usual, and when they came to Thórsá they heard
a rumour to the effect that Thorbiörn was there in hiding
with not a few men, and that he intended to attack them if
he had an opportunity. Then the Earls called men together,
and went with a hundred men, twenty of whom were on
horseback and the rest on foot. In the evening they went
up into the valley,<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c017'><sup>[442]</sup></a> and took up their quarters for the night.
When they were sitting by the fire in the evening, Earl
Rögnvald sneezed very much. Earl Harald said: “That was
a loud sneeze, kinsman.” In the morning they went along
the valley.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the day Earl Rögnvald rode always ahead of his
men, and a man with him called Asólf, and another by
name Jómar, his kinsman. They rode five together along
Kálfadal; and when they came to the farm, farmer Höskuld
was on the top of a corn-stack piling up the corn, which
his servants brought to him. Earl Harald was some distance
behind. When Höskuld recognised Earl Rögnvald,
he saluted him by name, and asked for news, speaking very
loud, so that he could be heard far away. This was a short
distance from the sitting-room of the house. The homestead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>stood on an eminence, and one had to go through
narrow and very steep passages up to it. Thorbiörn was at
this farm, and was sitting indoors drinking. The passages
led to the end of the house close to the gable, which had a
door filled loosely with stones. Thorbiörn and his men,
hearing the words of Höskuld when he saluted Earl Rögnvald,
seized their weapons, pushed the stones from the concealed
door, and ran out. Thorbiörn ran round the gable,
and on to the wall of the passage. The Earl was then
close to the door. Thorbiörn struck at him, and Asólf
warded off the blow with his hand, and it was cut off; and
then the sword touched the Earl’s chin, inflicting a great
wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>On receiving the blow Asólf said: “Let them serve the
Earl better who have to thank him for greater gifts.” He
was then eighteen winters old, and had lately entered the
Earl’s service.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald was going to jump off his horse, and his
foot stuck fast in the stirrup. At that moment Stefán
arrived and stabbed him with a spear; and Thorbiörn
wounded him again; but Jómar stabbed Thorbiörn in the
thigh, the spear entering the bowels. Then Thorbiörn and
his men ran behind the homestead, and down a steep bank,
into a wet morass. Then Earl Harald and his men arrived
and met Thorbiörn. They recognised each other, and the
Earl’s men, when they knew his intentions, advised to pursue
him; but Earl Harald dissuaded them from it, saying that
he wished to wait for Earl Rögnvald’s opinion, “Because,”
said he, “I am very intimately connected with Thorbiörn,
as you know, both through relationship and other ties.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who were with Earl Rögnvald stood sorrowing
over his dead body, and some time passed before Earl
Harald heard the news. Thorbiörn and his men had got
out on the bog, and across the moss-hag running along it.
But through the urgency of the Earl’s followers, he and his
men ran down to the bog, and they met at the moss-hag—the
two parties standing one on either side. Thorbiörn’s
party defended themselves from the bank, and his followers
ran to his assistance from the neighbouring homesteads,
until they were fifty in number. They defended themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>bravely, for they had a strong position. The moss-hag
was both deep and broad, and the bog was soft; so they
could only hurl spears at each other. Thorbiörn told his
men to throw none back; and when the Earl’s party had
exhausted their missiles they spoke to each other, and
Thorbiörn called to Earl Harald, saying, “Kinsman! I
wish to ask you to give me quarter, and I am willing
to leave the decision of this case entirely in your hands.
I will reserve nothing which may contribute to your honour.
I also think, kinsman, you must remember that there have
been quarrels in which you would not have made such a
difference between Earl Rögnvald and me that you would
have killed me for having done this deed, when he had you
under his thumb, and left you no more power than if you
had been his page; but I gave you the best gifts, and
endeavoured to further your honour in every way I could.
The deed which I have committed is indeed a great crime,
and weighs heavily upon me, but the whole of his dominions
revert to you. You may also know that Earl Rögnvald
intended for me the same fate which he met at my hands.
And I suspect, kinsman, that if it had so happened that I
were dead, and Earl Rögnvald alive, you would not have
quarrelled with him; and yet you wish to take away my
life.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorbiörn urged his case with many fair words, and
many pleaded for him, and begged that quarter might be
given him. And at last, when so many pleaded, the Earl
began to listen to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Magnus, the son of Gunni, Hávard’s son, a chief
and a kinsman of the Earl’s, and the noblest born of Earl
Harald’s followers, took speech as follows:—“We are not
able to counsel you, Earl, after these great deeds, but I shall
tell you what will be said if quarter is given to Thorbiörn
when he has done such a deed, and even dared to say to
your face, almost in so many words, that he has done this
wickedness in your interest, or for your honour; and it
will be an everlasting shame and dishonour to you and to
all the Earl’s kinsmen if he is not avenged. I think Earl
Rögnvald’s friends will believe it to be the truth that for
a long time you have been planning his death, and that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>is your plan which has now been accomplished. Do you
think he will acquit you from complicity in his guilt when
he has to defend himself; since no one says a word for you
when he tells you to your face that he has committed this
crime in your interest? And how can you better confirm
this suspicion than by now granting him peace? I have
resolved, for my part, never to give him quarter, if any
doughty men are willing to follow me, whether you like it
or not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>His brother Thorstein, and Hákon, and Swein, Hróald’s
son, spoke to the same effect. Then they left the Earl and
went along by the moss-hag, trying to find a place where
they might cross.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Thorbiörn saw Magnus and his followers walking
along the moss-hag, he said: “Now, I suppose, they
must have disagreed in their counsels; the Earl has wished
to give me peace, and Magnus has spoken against it.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While they were thus talking, Thorbiörn and his men
went farther away from the moss-hag.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harald’s party stood on the brink, and when he saw
that no quarter would be given, he leapt across in full
armour, though it was nine ells<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c017'><sup>[443]</sup></a> broad. His followers
leapt after him, but none of them were able to leap so far;
and most of them caught the bank and crawled up out of
the mud.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thorbiörn’s men urged him to advance against Magnus
and his men, and decide the matter with them; but he
said: “I think the best plan is, that each of you do what
he thinks likely to be best, but I shall go to Earl Harald.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of his men dissuaded him from this, and begged
him rather to flee to the woods and save himself. He did
not, however, accept that advice. Then his followers left
him, and tried to save themselves in various ways, and at
last there were eight men only with Thorbiörn. When he
saw that Earl Harald had crossed the ditch, he went to
him and fell on his knees, saying that he brought his head
to him.  Many of the Earl’s men asked that peace might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>be given him; and the Earl said: “Save yourself, Thorbiörn;
I have not the heart to kill you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>While they were talking, they moved down the valley
along Kalfadalsá,<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c017'><sup>[444]</sup></a> and Magnus’s party pursued them. When
the Earl saw it, he said: “Save yourself, Thorbiörn, I will
not fight for you against my men.” Then Thorbiörn and
his men left the Earl’s party, and went to some deserted
shielings called Asgrím’s ærgin.<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c017'><sup>[445]</sup></a> Magnus’s party pursued
them, and set the buildings on fire immediately. Thorbiörn
and his men defended themselves bravely; and when the
buildings began to fall down with the burning, they went
out and were attacked by the other party with their weapons,
as soon as they could reach them. They were already very
much exhausted by the fire, and fell there all nine. When
Thorbiörn’s wounds were examined, it was found that the
intestines protruded through the wound inflicted by Jómar.
Earl Harald led his men down the valley, but those who
were with Magnus went to Fors (Forss), wrapped up Earl
Rögnvald’s body, and brought it down to Thórsá.</p>

</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Earl Rögnvald Kali</span> died five nights after the summer
Marymas.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c017'><sup>[446]</sup></a> Earl Harald brought the body with a splendid
following to the Orkneys, and it was buried at the Magnus
Kirk; and there it rested until God manifested Rögnvald’s
merits by many and great miracles. Then Bishop Bjarni
had his holy remains exhumed with the permission of the
Pope.<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c017'><sup>[447]</sup></a> Where the blood of the Earl fell on the stones
when he died, it may be seen to this day as fresh as if it
had just come from the wounds.</p>
<p class='c008'>Earl Rögnvald’s death was much lamented, because he
was very popular in the Islands and in many other parts.
He had been helpful to many, was liberal with his money,
gentle, and a true friend, highly accomplished, and a good
scald. He left a daughter, Ingigerd, an only child, who
was married to Eirík Slagbrellir. Their children were
Harald Ungi, Magnus Mangi, Rögnvald, Ingibiorg, Elín, and
Ragnhild.</p>

<h3 id='ch-cix' class='c001'>CHAPTER CIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF HARALD AND SWEIN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>After</span> Earl Rögnvald’s death, Earl Harald took possession
of the whole of the Islands, and became their sole ruler.
He was a mighty chief, and a man of large stature and
great strength. His wife was Afreka, and their children
were—Heinrek, Hákon, Helena, and Margarét. When
Hákon was only a few winters old, Swein, Asleif’s son,
offered to foster him, and when he was able to take his
part with other men, Swein took him out on marauding
expeditions every summer, and honoured him in everything.
Swein used to reside at home in Gáreksey, in
winter, keeping there eighty men at his own expense. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>had such a large drinking-hall that there was none equal to
it anywhere else in the Orkneys. In the spring he was
very busy sowing a large breadth of seed, and he usually
did a great part of the work himself. When this work
was finished, he went every spring on marauding expeditions.
He plundered in the Sudreyar and Ireland, and
returned home after midsummer. This he called spring-viking.
Then he stayed at home till the fields were reaped
and the corn brought in. Then he went out again, and did
not return until one month of winter had passed. This he
called autumn-viking.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SWEIN GOES TO IRELAND.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Once</span> it happened that Swein went out on a spring expedition,
taking with him Hákon, the son of Earl Harald. They
had five rowing ships, all large. They plundered in the
Sudreyar. All the inhabitants were so afraid of him that
they hid all their movable property in the ground or in
heaps of loose stones. Swein went all the way south to
Man, and obtained very little booty. Then they went to
Ireland and plundered there, but when they were approaching
Dýflin (Dublin) two merchant-ships came from England,
laden with English cloth and other merchandise; they were
going to Dýflin. Swein made for the vessels, and offered
them battle. There was little resistance by the English,
and Swein’s party took every penny in the vessels, leaving
to the Englishmen only what they stood in, and a small
quantity of provisions. They sailed away in the vessels,
but Swein’s party went to the Sudreyar, and divided their
booty. They sailed from the west with great pomp. When
they were lying in harbours, they covered their ships with
the English cloth, to make a show; and when they sailed
to the Orkneys, they sewed the cloth upon their sails, and
then it looked as if the sails were made entirely of the fine
stuffs. This they named the Skrud-viking.<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c017'><sup>[448]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Swein went home to his estate in Gáreksey. He had
taken a large quantity of wine and English mead from the
vessels. When he had been at home a short time he invited
Earl Harald, and prepared a splendid feast for him. When
Earl Harald was at the feast a great deal was said of Swein’s
magnificence. The Earl said: “I wish, Swein, you would
now leave off your marauding expeditions; it is good now
to drive home a whole waggon. You know that your plundering
has fed you and your men a long time, but to most
men of violence it happens that they perish in their raiding,
if they do not leave it off in time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein looked to the Earl and said, smiling: “This is
well said, my Lord; you have spoken like a friend, and it
is good to take sound advice from you; but some complain
that you are not an over just man yourself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “I must be responsible for my own
acts, but I spoke as it occurred to me.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Swein replied: “Your intention is no doubt good, my
Lord; and it shall be so, that I will discontinue my marauding
expeditions, for I am getting old, and my strength is
wasting away in the wet work and the fighting. I am now
going to make an autumn expedition, and I wish it to be
not less glorious than the spring one. Then I shall leave
off war-going.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “It is difficult to know, comrade,
which comes first—death or lasting fame.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then their conversation ceased. When Earl Harald
left the feast honourable gifts were presented to him, and
he and Swein parted very good friends.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON’S (LAST) EXPEDITION.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Shortly</span> after this Swein prepared to go on a marauding expedition
with seven long-ships, all of them large. Hákon,
the son of Earl Harald, went with him. They went first to
the Sudreyar, and found there little booty. Then they went
to Ireland, and plundered there in many places.  They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>went all the way south to Dýflin (Dublin), and took the
inhabitants by surprise, so that they did not know till they
were in the town. They took a great deal of plunder, and
took captive the rulers of the city, and their negotiations
ended in the surrender of the town to Swein, and they promised
to pay as much money as he might levy on them.
He was to quarter his men on the town, and have the command
of it, and the Dýflin men confirmed this arrangement
with oaths. Swein and his men went down to their ships
in the evening, but in the morning they were to come into
the town and receive hostages from the inhabitants.</p>
<p class='c008'>Now it is to be told what was going on in the town
during the night. The rulers of the town had a meeting,
and considered the difficulties in which they were placed.
They thought it a grievous hardship that they should have
to surrender their town to the Orkneymen, especially to him
whom they knew to be the most exacting man in the whole
West; and they came to the determination to play him
false if they could. They resolved to dig large pits inside
of the city gates, and in many other places between the
houses, where it was intended that Swein’s men should
come in, and armed men were hidden in the houses close
by. They placed such coverings over the pits as were sure
to fall in when the weight of the men came upon them.
Then they covered all over with straw, so that the pits
could not be seen, and waited till morning.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON’S FALL.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Next</span> morning Swein and his men arose and armed themselves,
and went to the town; and when they came near the
gates the Dýflin men ranged themselves on both sides from
the gates along by the pits. Swein and his men, not being
on their guard, fell into them. Some of the townsmen ran
immediately to the gates, and others to the pits, and attacked
Swein’s men with weapons. It was difficult for them to
defend themselves, and Swein perished there in the pit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>with all those who had entered the town. It was said that
Swein was the last man who died there, and that he spake
these words before his fall: “Know all men, whether I die
to-day or not, that I am the holy Earl Rögnvald’s henchman,
and my confidence is where he is with God.” Swein’s surviving
followers went then to their ships, and put out to sea;
and nothing is said of their voyage until they came to the
Orkneys. Here is the end of Swein’s history; and it has
been said that he was the greatest man in the Western
lands, either in old times or at the present day, of those who
had not a higher title than he had. After his death his sons
Olaf and Andrés divided their patrimony. The next summer
after his death they raised the end walls of the large drinking-hall
which he had in Gáreksey. Andrés, the son of Swein,
married Frída, the daughter of Kolbein Hruga, and sister to
Bishop Bjarni.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CXIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF EARL HARALD AND HIS SONS.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> Earl Harald ruled the Orkneys, and was a great chief.
Afterwards<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c017'><sup>[449]</sup></a> he married Hvarflod,<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c017'><sup>[450]</sup></a> the daughter of Earl
Malcolm,<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c017'><sup>[451]</sup></a> of Mærhæfi (Moray). Their children were
Thorfinn,<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c017'><sup>[452]</sup></a> David, Jón, Gunnhild, Herborga, and Langlíf.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>When Bishop William the Second was dead, Bjarni, the
son of Kolbein Hruga, was made bishop after him. He was
a very great man, and a dear friend of Earl Harald. Bishop
Bjarni had a large party of kinsmen in the Islands. The
sons of Eirík Slagbrellir were Harald Ungi, Magnus Mangi,
and Rögnvald. The brothers went east to Norway to see
King Magnus, Erling’s son, and he gave Harald the title of
Earl, and one half of the Islands, which had belonged to
the holy Earl Rögnvald, his mother’s father. Earl Harald
Ungi went to the west, and with him Sigurd Murt, the son
of Ivar Galli. The mother of Ivar, who fell at Akr with
Erling Skakki, was the daughter of Hávard, Gunni’s son.
Sigurd Murt was young, handsome, and a great dandy.
Magnus Mangi remained with the King, and fell with him
in Sogn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Harald (Ungi) and his followers came first to Hjaltland.
Then they went over to Caithness, and then into Scotland, to
William, King of Scots.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c017'><sup>[453]</sup></a> Earl Harald requested King William
to give him the half of Caithness which Earl Rögnvald
had held. The King granted him this; and Earl Harald
went then down to Caithness, and gathered troops. Then
Lífólf Skalli, his brother-in-law, came to him. He had many
noble kinsmen there. Lífólf had married Ragnhild, the sister
of Earl Harald. He was called Earl Harald Ungi (the
younger); but Harald, Maddad’s son, the elder. Lífólf had
the command of the Earl’s troops. They sent men to the
Orkneys, to Earl Harald the elder, requesting him to give up
one half of the Islands, since the King had given them to
Earl Harald Ungi. When the Earl received this message,
he refused absolutely to divide his dominions on any condition.
Lífólf Skalli was the messenger, and the Earl upbraided
him greatly before he left. After this, Earl Harald the elder
collected troops, and obtained a great many. Earl Harald
Ungi’s party were in Caithness, and had some gathering too.
When they heard that Harald the elder was collecting troops,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>they sent Lífólf a second time across the Pentland Firth
to gather information about the enemy’s forces. He landed
east in Rögnvaldsey, and ascended a hill, where he found
three of Harald’s watchmen. Two of them he killed, and
one of them he took with him for information. Then Lífólf
saw the Earl’s fleet, which consisted of many ships, most
of them large. Then he went down from the hill to his
boat, and told his companions what he had ascertained. He
said Earl Harald had so large an army that it was quite
hopeless for them to fight with him. “I would advise,” said
Lífólf, “that we should go to-day to Thórsá, and there many
troops will come to us at once. If you wish to offer battle
to Earl Harald now, it is most imprudent, whatever the result
may be.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then said Sigurd Murt: “Ill has the Earl’s brother-in-law
fared across the Pentland Firth if he has left his heart
behind him;” adding, further, that their prospects were not
bright if all should lose heart when they saw Earl Harald’s
army.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lífólf replied: “It is difficult to see, Sigurd, where each
one carries his heart when courage is required; and I believe
you men of mark will think it a serious matter to remain
behind when I run from Harald Ungi.”</p>

<p class='c008'>They did not go to Thórsá; but shortly after they saw
Earl Harald’s fleet coming from Rögnvaldsey, and then they
prepared for battle. Earl Harald went on shore, and placed
his men in battle array. They far exceeded the others
in number. Sigurd Murt and Lífólf arranged the troops
of Earl Ungi. The former was dressed in a scarlet tunic,
and tucked the skirt under his belt. Some said that the
same should be done behind, but he told them not to do
it, “for,” said he, “I shall not go backwards to-day.” Lífólf
and Sigurd led one wing each, and when they had arrayed
their men the battle began with great fury. Among the
troops of Earl Harald the elder there were many hardy,
fierce, and well-armed men, the Bishop’s kinsmen, and
many others of the Earl’s champions. When the battle had
lasted for a while, Sigurd Murt fell, having borne himself
well and bravely. Lífólf behaved the most valiantly of them
all. The Caithnessmen say he broke three times through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the ranks of Earl Harald’s men, yet he fell in this fight, after
having earned great fame. When both were dead—Lífólf
and Sigurd Murt—Earl Ungi’s men fled. Earl Harald Ungi
fell at some turf-pits,<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c017'><sup>[454]</sup></a> and that very night a great light was
seen where his blood fell on the ground. People said he
was truly a saint, and there is now a church where he fell.
He is buried in Ness (Caithness). Innumerable miracles
are by God granted through his merits, which testify that
he wished to go to Orkney to his kinsmen Earl Magnus
and Earl Rögnvald. After the battle Earl Harald subdued
the whole of Caithness, and went back triumphant to the
Orkneys.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE ORKNEYMEN.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>William</span>, King of Scots, heard that Earl Harald (Ungi) had
been killed, and also that Earl Harald, Maddad’s son, had
subdued the whole of Caithness without asking his leave.
He became enraged at this, and sent men to the Sudreyar to
Rögnvald, Gudröd’s son, the King of the Sudreyar. Gudröd’s
mother was Ingibiorg, daughter of Earl Hákon, Paul’s
son. King Rögnvald was the greatest warrior then in the
western lands. Three winters he had been out in war-ships
without coming under a sooty rafter. When this message
came to Rögnvald, he collected an army from all the kingdom
of the Sudreyar and from Satiri (Kintyre). He had
also a large army from Ireland. Then he went north to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Caithness, took possession of the whole of the territory, and
remained there some time. Earl Harald kept in the Orkneys,
and took no heed of the King’s movements. Towards
winter King Rögnvald prepared to go home to his dominions
in the Sudreyar. He left three stewards (sýslumenn) over
Caithness. One was Máni, Olaf’s son; the second Rafn, the
lawman; and the third, Hlífólf Alli. Some time after, King
Rögnvald returned to the Sudreyar. Earl Harald sent a man
over to Ness (Caithness), saying that he would consider his
journey a lucky one if he could kill any of the stewards or all
of them. This man was brought across the Pentland Firth,
and he went on till he came to Lawman Rafn. Rafn asked
him where he was going, and he had little to say in reply.
Rafn said: “I can see in you that Earl Harald has sent you
over here for some evil purpose, but I have not the heart to
slay you, because you are my kinsman.” Thus they parted,
and he went away to Hlífólf, and their intercourse ended
in Hlífólf’s murder. Then he fled to the Orkneys to Earl
Harald, and told him what he had done.</p>
<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>HARALD TORTURES THE BISHOP.</span></h3>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> Earl Harald prepared to leave the Orkneys, and
when he was quite ready he went first to Thórsá, and landed
from his ships there. The Bishop was in the borg at Skárabólstad
(Scrabster). When the Caithnessmen saw Earl
Harald’s army, they perceived it was so numerous that they
had no chance to withstand them. They were told also that
the Earl was in such an evil temper that there was no knowing
what he might do. Then the Bishop took speech, and
said: “If our dealings turn out well, he will give you
peace.”<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c017'><sup>[455]</sup></a> They did as the Bishop told them. The Earl’s
men rushed from the ships up to the borg. The Bishop
went to meet the Earl, and saluted him with bland words,
but their dealing turned out in this way, that Earl Harald
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>had the Bishop seized, his tongue cut out, and then he caused
a knife to be thrust into his eyes, and blinded him. Bishop
Jón prayed to the holy virgin Tröllhæna during his torture,
and then he went on a certain bank, when they let him
go.  There was a woman on the bank, and the Bishop
asked her to help him. She saw that blood was flowing
from his face, and said: “Be silent, my lord, and I shall
willingly help you.” The Bishop was brought to the resting-place
of the holy Tröllhæna,<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c017'><sup>[456]</sup></a> and there he recovered both
his speech and sight.</p>
<p class='c008'>Earl Harald went up to the borg, and it was immediately
surrendered to him.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c017'><sup>[457]</sup></a> He proceeded at once to punish the
inhabitants severely, and imposed heavy fines on those whom
he considered most guilty of treachery to him; and he made
all the Caithnessmen acknowledge him by oath as their lord,
whether they liked it or not. Then he took possession of all
the property belonging to the stewards, who had fled to the
King of Scots. Then Earl Harald resided in Caithness with
many men.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OF THE STEWARDS.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>Now</span> it is to be told of the stewards (sýslumenn) that they
went six together to Scotland, and saw the King during
Advent. They were able to give particular intelligence of
everything that had happened in Caithness during Earl
Harald’s stay there. The King was highly enraged at
hearing the news, but he said he would pay back double to
those who had lost their own. The first day they stayed
with the King twenty-five ells of cloth and an English mark
in ready money was given to each of them. They spent
the Yule-tide with the King, and were well treated.</p>
<p class='c008'>After Yule-tide the King sent word to all the chiefs in
his kingdom, and collected a large army throughout the
country, and with all these troops he went down to Caithness
against Earl Harald. With this great army he pursued his
journey till he came to Eysteinsdal,<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c017'><sup>[458]</sup></a> where Caithness and
Sutherland meet. The camp of the King of Scots stretched
far along the valleys.</p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Harald was in Caithness when he heard the news,
and he drew troops together immediately. It is said he obtained
six thousand men, and yet he had no chance to withstand
the King of Scots. Then he sent men to him to sue
for peace. When this request was brought before the King,
he said it was no use asking for peace unless he had every
fourth penny that was to be found in all the land of Caithness.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the Earl received this message, he called together
the inhabitants and chiefs, and consulted with them. As,
however, they had no means of resisting, it was agreed that
the Caithnessmen should pay one-fourth of all their property
to the King of Scots, except those men who had gone to see
the King in winter. Earl Harald went out to the Orkneys,
and was to have Caithness as he had it before it was given
to Earl Harald Ungi by the King of Scots. Thorfinn, the son
of Earl Harald, who was a hostage with the King of Scots,
was blinded during these hostilities.</p>

<p class='c008'>When peace had been made, the King returned to Scotland.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Earl Harald was now the sole ruler of the Orkneys.
In the later part of the days of Earl Harald, his brother-in-law,
Olaf, and Jón, Hallkell’s son, raised a party in the
Orkneys, and went east to Norway against King Sverrir.
They made Sigurd, the son of King Magnus, Erling’s son,
their King. Many men of noble birth in the Orkneys
joined this party, and it was very strong. They were for a
while called Eyjarskeggiar (Islanders) or Gullbeinir (goldenlegs).
They fought with King Sverrir in Flóruvogar, and
were beaten.<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c017'><sup>[459]</sup></a> Both Jón and Olaf were killed, as also their
King, and most of their men. After this King Sverrir
became a great enemy of Earl Harald, laying it to his charge
that he was the cause of the party being raised. At last
Earl Harald went from the west, and Bishop Bjarni went
along with him. The Earl left his case without reservation
to the decision of King Sverrir. Then King Sverrir took all
Hjaltland from Earl Harald, with its taxes (scat) and dues, as
a fine; and the Earls of Orkney have never had it since.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c017'><sup>[460]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Earl Harald was five winters old when he was made
Earl, and for twenty winters he and Earl Rögnvald were
together Earls of Orkney. After Earl Rögnvald’s death, he
was forty-eight winters Earl of Orkney, and he died in the
second year of the reign of King Ingi, Bard’s son.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c017'><sup>[461]</sup></a> Earl
Harald’s sons, Jón and David, succeeded him; and Heinrek,
his son, had Ross in Scotland.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following have been the most powerful of the Earls
of Orkney, according to the relation of those who have made
histories of them:—Sigurd, Eystein’s son; Earl Thorfinn,
Sigurd’s son; and Earl Harald, Maddad’s son.</p>

<p class='c008'>The brothers Jón and David ruled the land after their
father, until David died from disease, the same year as
Hákon Galinn died in Norway.<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c017'><sup>[462]</sup></a> After that Jón took the

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER CXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE BURNING OF BISHOP ADAM.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>When</span> Bishop Jón, he who was maimed by the order of Earl
Harald, died in Caithness, a man who was called Adam was
made Bishop in his stead. None knew his family, because
when a child he was found at the door of a certain church.
The Caithnessmen found him rather exacting in his office, and
blamed a certain monk who was with him chiefly for that.
It was an ancient custom that the Bishop should receive a
spann<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c017'><sup>[463]</sup></a> of butter of every twenty cows. Every Bondi in
Caithness had to pay this—he more who had more cows, and
he who had fewer less, and so in proportion. Bishop Adam
wished to increase the impost, and demanded a spann of every
fifteen cows; and when that was obtained, he demanded it
of twelve; and when this too was conceded, he demanded it
of ten. But this was thought by all men most unreasonable.</p>
<p class='c008'>Then the Caithnessmen went to see Earl Jón, who was
then in Caithness, and they complained of this before the
Earl. He said he would have nothing to do with it, adding
that the case was not a difficult one. There were two alternatives:
this was not to be endured, yet he would not say
what the other might be.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bishop Adam was at Há Kirkia,<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c017'><sup>[464]</sup></a> in Thorsdal, and Earl
Jón was a short distance off. The Caithnessmen held a
meeting on a hill above the village where the Bishop was.
Lawman Rafn was with the Bishop, and begged him to spare
the inhabitants, saying that otherwise he feared the consequences.
The Bishop asked him to be of good cheer, saying
that the Bœndr (farmers) would become quiet of their own
accord. Then a man was sent to Earl Jón, requesting him
to make peace between them and the Bishop. But the
Earl would not meddle with the matter at all. Then the
Bœndr ran down from the hill in great excitement, and
when Lawman Rafn saw it he warned the Bishop to take
care of himself. The Bishop and his friends were drinking
in a loft there, and when the Bœndr arrived the monk went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to the door, and he was immediately hewn across the face,
and fell back into the room dead. When the Bishop heard
it, he said: “This did not happen sooner than might have
been expected, for his interference in our transactions has
generally been unfortunate.” Then Rafn asked the Bishop
to tell the Bœndr that he was willing to come to an agreement
with them; and when they heard it, all the wiser men
among them were very glad. Then the Bishop went out to
make an arrangement with them; but when he was seen by
the more wicked ones, who were most furious, they seized
the Bishop, brought him into a small house, and set fire to
it, and the house burnt so quickly that those who wished to
save the Bishop could not do anything. Bishop Adam
perished there.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c017'><sup>[465]</sup></a> His body was not much burnt when it
was found. Then the body was buried suitably and honourably;
but those who had been the best friends of the Bishop
sent men to the King of Scots. Alexander, son of the holy
King William, was then King of Scotland. When he heard
the tidings, he became so enraged that the punishments
inflicted by him for the burning of the Bishop, by mutilation
and death, confiscation and outlawry from the land, are
still in fresh memory.</p>

    <div class='c000'>(<i>From the Flateyjarbók.</i>)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Dominions of King Harald and Earl Rögnvald.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>179.  Earl Rögnvald assisted Harald Harfagri (fair-haired) to
conquer the country (Norway), and he gave him the revenues of
both Mœri and Raumsdal. Rögnvald had married Ragnhild, the
daughter of Hrólf Nefia (nose). They had a son named Hrólf, who
conquered Normandy. Hrólf was so big that no horse could carry
him, and he was therefore called Gönguhrólf (Hrólf the walker). From
him the Earls of Rúda (Rouen) and the Kings of England are descended.
They had two other sons, Ivar and Earl Thórir Thegiandi
(the silent). Rögnvald had also sons by his concubines. They were
Hallad, Hrollaug, and Einar, who was the youngest. One summer
Harald Harfagri went to the west across the sea to punish the Vikings,
as he was weary of their devastations. They plundered in Norway
during the summer, and spent the winters in Hjaltland or the Orkneys.
Harald subdued Hjaltland, the Orkneys, and the Sudreyar (Hebrides).
He went west as far as the Isle of Man, and destroyed all the dwellings
in Man. He fought many battles there, and extended his dominion
so far to the west that none of the Kings of Norway since his time
has had wider dominions. In one of these battles, Ivar, the son of Earl
Rögnvald, fell. So when King Harald sailed from the west he gave
Hjaltland and the Orkneys to Earl Rögnvald as a compensation for
[the loss of] his son; but Earl Rögnvald gave the Islands to his
brother Sigurd, who was King Harald’s forecastleman; and the King
gave him the title of Earl before he left the west. Sigurd remained
out in the west.</p>
<h3 id='ch-180' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Earl Melbrigd slain by Sigurd.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>180. Earl Sigurd became a great chief. He formed an alliance
with Thorstein the Red, son of Olaf the White, and Aud Djúpaudga
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>(the very wealthy), and together they conquered all Caithness and
much more of Scotland—Mærhæfui (Moray) and Ross. He built a
borg on the southern border of Mærhæfui. Melbrigd Tönn (tooth),
an Earl of the Scots, and Earl Sigurd, made an arrangement to meet
in a certain place, with forty men each, in order to come to an agreement
concerning their differences. When the appointed day arrived
Earl Sigurd was suspicious of treachery on the part of the Scots.
He therefore caused eighty men to be mounted on forty horses.
When Earl Melbrigd saw this, he said to his men:—“Now we have
been treacherously dealt with by Earl Sigurd, for I see two men’s
legs on one side of each horse, and the men, I believe, are thus twice
as many as the beasts. But let us be brave, and kill each his man
before we die.” Then they made themselves ready. When Sigurd
saw it, he also decided on his plan, and said to his men:—“Now, let
one-half of our number dismount and attack them from behind, when
the troops meet, while we shall ride at them with all our speed to
break their battle array.” There was hard fighting immediately, and
it was not long till Earl Melbrigd fell, and all his men with him.
Earl Sigurd and his men fastened the heads [of the slain] to their
saddle-straps, in bravado, and so they rode home triumphing in their
victory. As they were proceeding, Earl Sigurd, intending to kick at
his horse with his foot, struck the calf of his leg against a tooth
protruding from Earl Melbrigd’s head, which scratched him slightly;
but it soon became swollen and painful, and he died of it. Sigurd
the powerful was buried in a mound at Ekkialsbakki.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c017'><sup>[466]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>Sigurd’s son was named Guthorm. He reigned one winter, and
died childless.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Earl Rögnvald heard of the death of Earl Sigurd and his
son, he sent his son Hallad out to the west, and King Harald gave
him the title of Earl. Hallad came out to the west, and took up his
residence in Hrossey,<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c017'><sup>[467]</sup></a> but Vikings went prowling about the islands
and outlying headlands, slaying men and seizing booty. The Bœndr
complained of their losses to Earl Hallad, but they thought he did
not get them much redress for their wrongs. Then Hallad grew
tired of the dignity, and resigned the earldom, took up his odal
rights, and returned to Norway, and his journey was regarded as a
very ignominious one.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Einar comes to the Islands.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>181. Two Danish Vikings took up their quarters in the Islands;
one of them was called Thórir Tréskegg (wooden beard), the other
Kálf Skurfa (scurf). When Earl Rögnvald heard this he became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>very angry, and called his sons Thórir and Hrollaug. Hrólf was
at that time on a war expedition. Rögnvald asked which of them
would go to the Islands. Thórir said he would follow his advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “I foresee that your power will be greatest
here; and your ways do not lead from home.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Hrollaug said: “Father, would you like me to go?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl replied: “It will never be your fortune to become an
Earl. Your way lies towards Iceland. There you will increase your
family, and it will be a noble one.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then Einar, his youngest son, came forward and said: “Would
you like me to go to the Islands? One thing I will promise, which
will be very acceptable to you—viz. that I shall never more come
into your presence; little honour do I enjoy at home, and it is hardly
likely that my success will be less elsewhere than it is here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Earl said: “You are not likely to become a chief, on account
of your birth, for all your kin on the mother’s side are thrall-born;
but it is true that the sooner you go and the longer you stay the
more agreeable it will be to me.” Earl Rögnvald gave him a fully-equipped
vessel, with twenty benches, and King Harald gave him the
title of Earl.</p>
<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Vikings slain.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>182. Einar sailed to Hjaltland, and there many men gathered
round him. Then he went to the Orkneys to meet Kálf Skurfa and
Thórir Tréskegg. There was a great battle, and both the Vikings
were killed. This was said about it:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Tré-skegg gave he to the Trows:</div>
      <div class='line'>Skurfa fell before Torf-Einar.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then Einar took possession of the lands, and soon became a great
chief. He was the man who first cut turf (peat) from the ground for
fuel at Torfnes in Scotland, for fuel was scarce in the Islands. Einar
was a tall man, ugly, and with one eye, yet he was very keen-sighted.</p>
<h3 id='ch-183' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Battle between Earl Einar and Prince Halfdan.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>183. When the sons of Harald Harfagri grew up they became men
of great violence and turbulence, as has been told before. The sons
of Snæfríd, Hálfdán Hálegg (high legs) and Gudröd Liomi (splendour)
killed Rögnvald, Earl of Mœri. King Harald became very
angry at this, and Hálfdán had to flee over seas to the west, but
Gudröd became reconciled to his father. When Hálfdán Hálegg
came to the Orkneys, Earl Einar fled from the Islands to Scotland,
and Hálfdán became King over the Islands. Earl Einar came back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>during the same year, and when they met there was a great battle,
in which Einar had the victory, and Hálfdán fled away. Einar sang
this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Why are not the spear-shafts flying,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the hands of Hrólf and Hrollaug,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thickly ’gainst the press of warriors?</div>
      <div class='line'>Now, my father! I avenge thee.</div>
      <div class='line'>While we here are closed in battle,</div>
      <div class='line'>Sits Earl Thórir all the evening,</div>
      <div class='line'>Silent o’er his cheerless drink.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Next morning they found Hálfdán Hálegg on Rinar’s Hill. The
Earl made a blood eagle be cut on his back with the sword, and had
his ribs severed from the back-bone, and his lungs pulled out. Thus
he gave him to Odinn as an offering for victory, and sang this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oft it is that bearded men</div>
      <div class='line'>Are guilty deemed for taking sheep;</div>
      <div class='line'>But my offence is that I slew</div>
      <div class='line'>The young son of the Islands’ king.</div>
      <div class='line'>Men may say that danger waits me</div>
      <div class='line'>From the great king’s speedy vengeance;</div>
      <div class='line'>But his wrath shall never daunt me,</div>
      <div class='line'>In whose shield I’ve made a dint.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Then he had a cairn raised over him, and sang this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Vengeance for my father’s death</div>
      <div class='line'>I have ta’en for my fourth share.</div>
      <div class='line'>In him the people’s champion fell;</div>
      <div class='line'>But it was the Norns’ decree.</div>
      <div class='line'>Heap we now a cairn o’er High-leg,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thus the hard skatt we shall pay him</div>
      <div class='line'>Which as victors we are due him.</div>
      <div class='line'>Let the wise to me now listen.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>When this was heard in Norway his brothers became greatly enraged,
and threatened an expedition to the Islands to avenge him, but
Harald delayed their journey. When Earl Einar heard of their threats,
he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Men of no ignoble birth</div>
      <div class='line'>Are they who, from my native land,</div>
      <div class='line'>Seek my life for vengeance’ sake;</div>
      <div class='line'>But the truth is, that they know not,</div>
      <div class='line'>Till their swords have surely slain me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whom the eagles’ claws shall rend.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Some time afterwards King Harald set out for the western seas,
and came to the Islands. Einar fled from the Islands to Caithness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Then men went between them, and they made peace. King Harald
imposed a fine upon the Islands, adjudging them to pay sixty marks
of gold. Earl Einar offered [to the Bœndr] to pay the money himself,
on condition that he should become proprietor of all their freeholds.
The Bœndr accepted this, because the wealthy men thought they
might redeem their freeholds, and the poorer men had no money.
Einar paid the whole sum, and for a long time afterwards the Earls
held all the odal lands, until Earl Sigurd gave back their odal possessions
to the Orkneymen. King Harald went back to Norway, but
Earl Einar ruled over the Orkneys a long time, and died on a sick-bed.
He had three sons: one was named Arnkell, the second Erlend,
and the third Thorfinn Hausakliuf (skull-splitter).</p>

<p class='c008'>When Harald Harfagri died, Eirík Blódöx (bloody-axe) was King
for two winters. Then Hakon, Athelstan’s foster son, came to the
land, and Eirík fled. Arnkell and Erlend, the sons of Torf Einar,
fell with Eirík Blódöx in England. Gunnhild and her sons then
went to the Orkneys, and took possession of them, and stayed there
for a time. From thence they went to Denmark, but before they
went away they married Ragnhild, the daughter of Gunnhild and
Eirík, to Arnfinn, the son of Earl Thorfinn [Hausakliuf], and Earl
Thorfinn took up his residence in the Islands: he was a great and
warlike chief. He died on a sick-bed, and was buried in a mound on
Hauga Heath,<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c017'><sup>[468]</sup></a> in Rögnvaldsey, and was considered to have been a
great man.</p>

<h3 id='ch-184' class='c016'><span class='sc'>The Murder of Havard.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>184. Thorfinn had five sons. One was named Hávard Arsæli
(blessed with good seasons), the second Hlödver, the third Liót, the
fourth Skúli, and the fifth Arnfinn. Ragnhild, the daughter of Eirík,
killed her husband Arnfinn at Myrkhol (Murkle), in Caithness, and
then she married Hávard Arsæli, his brother. He became Earl, and
was a good chief, and blessed with good seasons. There was a man
named Einar Klíning (buttered bread), the son of Hávard’s sister.
He was a great chief, and had many men, and went usually on war
expeditions during the summer. He accepted an invitation from
Hávard, and at that feast he and Ragnhild talked much together.
She said that it was more suitable that such a man as he should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>chief and Earl than Hávard his kinsman, adding that the woman was
well married who had him for a husband. Einar told her not to
speak of such things, saying that Hávard was the noblest man in the
Islands, and that she was well matched. Ragnhild replied: “Hávard
and I shall not be long together after this. But it is true that men
will be found in the Islands who will not stick at trifles if you grudge
me the dignity.” By her persuasion Einar was moved to covetousness
and treachery against his kinsman. They agreed that he should kill
the Earl, and that she should marry him. Some time after Einar prepared
to take out his men, but a certain spaeman who was with him
said: “Do not engage in this business to-day; wait till to-morrow, or
else family murders will be frequent in your family.” Einar pretended
not to hear this. At this time Hávard was at Steinsness,<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c017'><sup>[469]</sup></a> in Hrossey.
There they met, and there was hard fighting, and it was not long till
the Earl fell. The place is now called Hávard’s teigar.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c017'><sup>[470]</sup></a> When this
became known, Einar was considered a great nithing<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c017'><sup>[471]</sup></a> for the deed.
Ragnhild would have nothing to do with him, saying it was a mere lie
that she had given him any promises. Then she sent for Einar Hardkiöpt
(hard mouth), who was the son of another sister of Hávard.
And when they met, she said it was a great shame to Hávard’s kinsmen
that they did not avenge him, adding that she would do anything
that the Earl might be avenged. “It is evident,” she said, “that he
who avenges the Earl will be most esteemed by good people, and will
most deserve his dominions.” Einar replied: “It is said that you
sometimes speak differently from what you think. But he who does
this deed will expect in return that you will help him to the dominions,
as well as to other things which he will consider not less important.”
This was the end of their talk. After this Einar Hardkiöpt went to
Einar Klíning and killed him. But Ragnhild sent for their brother
Liót, and married him. Liót became Earl, and was a great chief.
Now Einar Hardkiöpt had killed his kinsman, and was not any nearer
the earldom than before. He was highly dissatisfied, and wished to
collect men together and subdue the Islands by force. He had great
difficulty in getting men, for the Orkneymen wished to serve the sons
of Thorfinn Hausakliuf. Some time afterwards the Earl had Einar
Hardkiöpt slain.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>
  <h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Battle between Liot and Skuli.</span></h3>
</div>
<p class='c010'>185. Skúli, the brother of Liót, went to Scotland, and had an
Earl’s title given him by the King of Scots. Then he went down to
Caithness, and collected forces together; from thence he went to
the Islands, and fought with his brother for the dominion of them.
Liót collected a numerous army, and went against Skúli. When
they met, Skúli would nothing but fight. There was a severely contested
battle. Liót gained the victory, and Skúli fled over to Ness
(Caithness). Liót pursued him, stayed there for a while, and got
many men together. Then Skúli came down from Scotland with a
large army, and met Liót at Dalir (Dale), in Caithness, and a great
battle ensued. Skúli had a large army given him by the King of
Scots and Earl Magbiód.<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c017'><sup>[472]</sup></a> In the beginning of the battle the Scots
fought hotly. Earl Liót told his men to act on the defensive, and to
stand firm; and when the Scots could not make any impression on
them, Liót incited his men, and fought very fiercely himself. When
this had been going on for some time, the array of the Scots was
broken, and then they fled; but Skúli continued the battle, and was
ultimately killed. Liót took possession of Caithness, and he and the
Scots were at war, because they were vexed at their defeat. When
Earl Liót was in Caithness, Earl Magbiód came down from Scotland
with a large army, and they met at Skida-mire (Skitten), in Caithness.
Although Earl Liót’s forces were not equal to those of the Scots, he
fought so bravely that the Scots gave way, and the battle had not
continued long when those of the Scots who were left alive fled, and
many of them were wounded. Liót returned from the pursuit victorious,
but with many men wounded, and he himself had received
wounds, of which he died.</p>

<h3 id='ch-186' class='c016'><span class='sc'>Battle.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>186. Hlödver was Earl after Liót, and became a great chief. He
married Audna, the daughter of Kiarval, the King of the Ivar.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c017'><sup>[473]</sup></a> Their
son was Sigurd the stout. Hlödver died on a sick-bed, and was buried
at Hofn (Huna), in Caithness. His son Sigurd succeeded him, and
became a great chief, with extensive possessions. He kept Caithness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>by main force from the Scots, and went every summer on war expeditions
to the Sudreyar (Hebrides), Scotland, and Ireland. One summer
Finnleik, an Earl of the Scots, challenged Sigurd to meet him at Skida-mire
on a certain day; but Sigurd went to consult his mother, who
was a wise woman. The Earl told her that the difference in numbers
would not be less than seven to one. She replied: “I should have
reared thee up long in my wool-bag if I had known that thou wouldst
wish to live for ever. It is fate that rules life, and not the place
where a man may go. It is better to die with honour than live with
shame. Take thou here this banner which I have made with all my
skill, and I ween that it will bring victory to him before whom it is
borne, but death to its bearer.” The banner was wrought with cunningly
executed handiwork and elaborate art. It was made in the
shape of a raven, and when floating in the wind it resembled the
raven flying. Earl Sigurd was very wroth at his mother’s words. He
restored their odal rights to the Orkneymen to induce them to assist
him, and went to meet Earl Finnleik at Skida-mire, where they both
placed their men in battle array. When the forces met, Earl Sigurd’s
standard-bearer was killed by an arrow. The Earl ordered another to
bear the banner, and when they had fought for a while he also fell.
Three standard-bearers were killed, but the Earl gained the victory,
and the Orkneymen regained their freeholds.</p>

<h3 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Meeting between Olaf (Tryggvi’s Son) and the Earl.</span></h3>
<p class='c010'>187. Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, sailed west to the Orkneys, as has been
mentioned before. But as the Pentland Firth was not to be passed
at the time, he moored his ships in Asmundarvag (Osmondwall) opposite
Rögnvaldsey. Earl Sigurd, Hlödver’s son, was there before him
with three ships, for he was going on a war expedition. When King
Olaf became aware that the Earl was there, he called him into his
presence. But when the Earl came to the King’s ship, the King
spoke as follows:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know, Earl Sigurd, that Harald Harfagri came here to the
west with an army when he had obtained possession of all Norway.
King Harald conquered the Orkneys and Hjaltland, and many other
lands here in the west. The King gave the Islands to Rögnvald the
Powerful as a compensation for his son, but Rögnvald gave them to
his brother Sigurd, and he became the Earl of King Harald. King
Harald went a second time against Earl Einar with a large army; but
well-disposed men mediated between them, and they agreed to the
following terms:—The King claimed all the Orkneys and Hjaltland
as his own; and the result of their negotiations was that the Earl paid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the King sixty marks of gold for the murder of his son, Halfdan Hálegg,
and Earl Einar then held the lands from King Harald. Shortly afterwards,
King Eirík, Harald’s son, came from Norway. Then also the
Earls, the sons of Torfeinar, were his vassals. This appears from the
fact that they gave him many men for his war expeditions. When
King Eirík came to the Islands a second time, he took away with him
the two Earls, Arnkell and Erlend, and appointed their brother Thorfinn
to rule over the land. They were both killed in England with King
Eirík. Then the sons of Eirík came from England and ruled over the
Islands, and when they departed they appointed Arnfinn, their brother-in-law,
ruler of the Islands. Havard first succeeded his brother (Arnfinn),
then Liót, and lastly your father, Hlödver. Now you, Sigurd,
are Earl over these lands which I claim as my possessions, with all
other lands possessed by Harald Harfagri and his kinsmen, and
descending from them to me by inheritance from generation to generation.
You know that most of the sons of Eirík and Gunnhild have
now been killed. And although their sister Ragnhild is still alive,
it seems to me that she has been guilty of such wickedness in the
Orkneys that she ought not to have dignity or power anywhere;
indeed, my view is that she has completely forfeited both property
and life if it be true that she has done all the shameful deeds that are
reported of her, and generally believed. Now, since it has so happened,
Earl Sigurd, that you have come into my power, you have to
choose between two very unequal alternatives. One is, that you
embrace the true faith, become my man, and be baptized with all your
subjects. In that case you may have certain hope of honour from me.
You shall hold in full liberty as my subject, and with the dignity of
an Earl, all the dominions which you have had before. And besides,
you will gain what is much more important—namely, to reign in
eternal joy in the kingdom of Heaven with the Almighty God. Of
this you may be sure if you keep his commandments. The other alternative
is a very hard one, and quite unlike the former—viz. that you
shall be slain on the spot, and after your death I will send fire and
sword throughout the Orkneys, burning homesteads and men, unless
this people is willing to accept immunity by believing in the true God.
And if you and your subjects choose the latter alternative, you and
they, who put your trust in idols, shall speedily die, and shall thereafter
be tormented in hell-fire, with wicked devils, without end.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When Earl Sigurd had listened to King Olaf’s long and eloquent
harangue, he hardened his mind against him, and said: “I will tell
you, King Olaf, that I have absolutely resolved that I will not, and I
dare not, renounce the faith which my kinsmen and forefathers had
before me, because I do not know better counsels than they, and I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>not know that the faith which you preach is better than that which
we have had and have held all our lives.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When the King saw that the Earl persisted obstinately in his
error, he caught hold of his young son, who was with him, and who
had been brought up in the Islands. The King carried this son of
the Earl to the forepart of the ship. There he drew his sword, and
made ready to hew the boy down, saying at the same time: “Now I
will show you, Earl Sigurd, that I shall spare no man who will not
serve Almighty God, or listen to my preaching of the blessed message.
Therefore I shall kill your son before your eyes this instant, with the
sword now in my hand, unless you and your men will serve my God.
For I shall not leave these Islands until I have completely fulfilled his
blessed commission, and you have been baptized along with this son
of yours whom I now hold.”</p>

<p class='c008'>And because the Earl was situated as he was, he chose the better
alternative of doing as the King desired, and so he embraced the true
faith. Then the Earl was baptized, and so were all the people of the
Orkneys. Then Earl Sigurd became the Earl of King Olaf according
to this world’s dignity, and held from him lands and dominions, and
gave him as a hostage his son who has already been mentioned. His
name was Hvelp or Hundi (whelp or hound). King Olaf had him
baptized by the name of Hlödver, and took him with him to Norway.
Earl Sigurd confirmed all their agreement with oaths. After this
King Olaf sailed from the Orkneys, leaving priests to instruct the
people in the holy faith. King Olaf and Earl Sigurd parted friends.
Hlödver lived but a short time, and after his death Earl Sigurd paid
no homage to King Olaf. Then he married the daughter of Melkolf,
the King of Scots, and their son was Thorfinn.</p>

at least 2000 might still be numbered. We have no estimate of the number
in Shetland, but there also they are very numerous. Not less remarkable is
the number of the early “dwellings of strength,” of which Mousa is the type—huge
edifices, constructed with amazing labour and wonderful skill. (See

Description, 1711, p. 15); at Stove in South Ronaldsay, Orkney (Peterkin’s
Rentals, No. III.); at the north head of the bay of Wick in Caithness; and
at Navidale in Sutherland. St. Columba’s three chapels in South Ronaldsay
were at Grymness, Hopay, and Loch of Burwick (Peterkin’s Rentals, No. III.
p. 86). There were also dedications to St. Columba in the islands of Sanday
and Hoy in Orkney, at Olrig and Dirlet in Caithness, on Island Comb, at
Tongue, and at Kilcalmkill in Sutherlandshire (Bishop Forbes’s Calendar of
Scottish Saints). St. Triduana, whose name has been corrupted into St.
Tredwell and St. Trudlin (the Tröllhæna of the Saga), had dedications in
Papa Westray in Orkney (Martin’s and Brand’s Descriptions), and at Kintradwell
in Sutherlandshire. It seems also, from the narrative of Bishop John’s
mutilation in the Saga, that there was a dedication to her near Thurso. St.
Brigid had chapels in Stronsay and Papa Stronsay in Orkney. But it is impossible
to tell how many of these early religious sites had similar dedications,
as scarcely a tithe of those that are known have preserved their names. Brand
and Sibbald both mention the fact that in their time there were still recognisable
the sites of 24 chapels in the island of Unst, 21 in the island of Yell,
10 or 11 in the island of Fetlar: 55 religious foundations in the three
most northerly islands of the Shetland group. The Christian period of the
Norse occupation is marked by dedications showing the influence of the
Crusades or of the national religious feeling. The dedications to the Holy
Cross, St. Mary, St. Peter, St. Lawrence, St. Olaf, and St. Magnus, are probably
all of this period.</p>

attempted are far from satisfactory. The Shetland and Orkney specimens are
in different styles of the Ogham writing, and the whole subject of the reading
and interpretation of the inscriptions in this character is beset with difficulties
of no ordinary kind. One rendering of the Bressay inscription makes it “the
cross of Natdod’s daughter here,” and on the other edge of the stone, “Benres
of the sons of the Druids here;” while the language is supposed to be a
mixture of Celtic and Icelandic. (Sculptured Stones of Scotland, vol. i. p. 30.)</p>

devil may not altogether be accounted for by the fervour of his Christianity,
was chased into the river, where he was in danger of being drowned by the
rising tide. In this emergency he made a vow as follows:—“Thy dog,
Apostle Peter, hath run twice to Rome, and he would run the third time if
thou gavest him leave.” The Irish Chronicle states that the full tide in
Dublin Bay on the day of the battle coincided with sunrise, and that the
returning tide in the evening aided in the destruction of the defeated
foreigners. The date assigned by the Chronicle for the battle is Good Friday,
23d April 1014. It has been found by astronomical calculation that the full
tide that morning did coincide with sunrise—a remarkable attestation of the
authenticity of the narrative.</p>

<div class='footnote c028' id='f45'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r45'>45</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Chronicle of Melrose, under the date 1175, it is stated that
“Laurentius, Abbot in Orkney, was made Abbot of Melrose.” But as his death
is recorded in the year 1178, the priest here mentioned by Hoveden must
have been a different person, though of the same name. At the same time, as
this passage shows that Earl Harald had a hird-priest named Laurentius, it is
not improbable that the so-called Orkney abbot, who was made abbot of
Melrose, may also have been Harald’s family or court priest. Being himself
the son of a Scottish earl, and allied by marriage first with the family of the
Earl of Fife, and subsequently with the MacHeths, and having, moreover,
such close relations with the abbey of Scone, it is not unlikely that he may
have had Scottish priests about his family in preference to those of Norwegian
extraction.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c028' id='f46'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r46'>46</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>So says the Saga. Fordun says that the use of his tongue and of one eye
was in some measure left him. The letter of Pope Innocent, addressed to the
Bishop of Orkney, prescribing the penance to be performed by the man who
mutilated the bishop, only mentions the cutting out of the tongue. It is as
follows:—</p>

<p class='c019'>“We have learnt by your letters that Lomberd, a layman, the bearer of
these presents, accompanied his earl on an expedition into Caithness; that
there the Earl’s army stormed a castle, killed almost all who were in it, and
took prisoner the Bishop of Caithness; and that this Lomberd, as he says,
was compelled by some of the earl’s soldiery to cut out the bishop’s tongue.
Now because the sin is great and grievous, in absolving him, according to the
form of the church, we have prescribed this penance for satisfaction of his
offence, and to the terror of others:—That he shall hasten home, and bare-footed,
and naked, except breeches, and a short woollen vest without sleeves,
having his tongue tied by a string, and drawn out so as to project beyond his
lips, and the ends of the string bound round his neck, with rods in his hand,
in sight of all men, walk for fifteen days successively through his own native
district, the district of the mutilated bishop, and the neighbouring country;
he shall go to the door of the church without entering, and there, prostrate
on the earth, undergo discipline with the rods he is to carry; he is thus to
spend each day in silence and fasting until evening, when he shall support
nature with bread and water only; after these fifteen days are passed he shall
prepare within a month to set out for Jerusalem, and there labour in the
service of the Cross for three years; he shall never more bear arms against
Christians; for two years he shall fast every Friday on bread and water,
unless by the indulgence of some discreet bishop, or on account of bodily infirmity,
this abstinence be mitigated. Do you then receive him returning in
this manner, and see that he observe the penance enjoined him.” (Epist.
Innoc. III. Lib. iii. No. 77; Diplom. Norvegicum, vii. 3.)</p>

made for William Sinclair of Roslin, in 1554, calls it:—“A Diploma or
Deduction concerning the Genealogies of the ancient Earls of Orkney, drawn
up from the most authentic records, by Thomas, Bishop of Orkney, with the
assistance of his clergy and others, in consequence of an order from King Eirik
of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, to investigate the rights of William
Sinclair to the earldom.” But in the document itself King Eirik is spoken of
as “our former lord of illustrious memory,” and the date is evidently
erroneous. It is probably to be assigned to about 1443. It was first printed
by Wallace in 1699, and subsequently by Jonæus in the appendix to the
Orkneyinga Saga in 1780; by Barry in his History of the Orkneys in 1805;

1282, were the letters addressed by the King of Norway (presumably Hakon)
to the inhabitants of Caithness. The inhabitants of Caithness seem to have
been also obliged by the Scottish King to give hostages for their fealty to
him. In the accounts of Laurence Grant, Sheriff of Inverness, for the year
1263, there is a charge of £15:6:3 for the expenses of twenty-one hostages
from Caithness, at the rate of one denarius (penny) for each per day for
twenty-five weeks, “and then they were set at liberty.” (Compota Camerarium

“put to dede by martyry,” and assigns as the reason that the Norwegians
would not have one who was of another nation and a female to be heir to the

occur:—“Sept. 1.—To Lord Eli de Hamville going by the king’s orders with
the Lord Bishop of Durham towards Scotland to meet the messengers of the
King of Norway and the princess, and was to return with the news to the
king. To John Tyndale, the messenger from the Bishop of St. Andrews, who

Meikle Ferry in Sutherland on the 30th, where they met the messengers from

(1291) Earl John of Orkney had a safe conduct to come to King Edward till
the 24th June, when the earl would doubtless communicate to the king all
that he knew of the princess’s death.</p>

England or the English, we would immediately endeavour to expel him
as our enemy, and the subverter of his own rights and ours, and make another
king who should be able to defend us. For so long as a hundred remain alive,
we never will in any degree be subject to the dominion of the English. Since

Stewart’s deed is the last Malise who was Earl of Stratherne seems to be
shown by another deed of Robert Stewart, dated in 1361, in which, as
Seneschal of Scotland and Earl of Stratherne, he grants to James Douglas the
lands of Kellor in Stratherne, “which the late Malise gave.” In the confirmation

the opinion of Father Hay, the panegyrist of the St. Clairs of Roslyn. He
says that “Henry, prince of Orknay, was more honoured than any of his ancestres,
for he had power to cause stamp coine within his dominions, to make laws,
to remitt crimes;—he had his sword of honour carried before him wheresoever he
went; he had a crowne in his armes, bore a crowne on his head when he constituted
laws; and, in a word, was subject to none, save only he held his lands
of the King of Danemark, Sweden, and Noraway, and entred with them, to
whom also it did belong to crowne any of those three kings, so that in all
those parts he was esteemed a second person to the king.” (Genealogie of the

“married Elisabeth Sparres, daughter of Malesius Sparres, Prince of Orkney,
Earl of Caithness and Stratherne, through which marriage he became Prince
of Orkney.” But Malise Sperra never had any connection with the earldoms
of Caithness or Stratherne. In another place, p. 33, he says that Sir William
Sinclair (who fell fighting with the Saracens in Spain in 1330) “was married to
Elizabeth Sparre, daughter to the Earle of Orkney, and so by her became the
first Earl of Orkney of the Saintclairs.  His name was Julius Sparre. He is
also reputed Earl of Stratherne and Caithness.” But this is manifestly a
tissue of impossibilities. He seems to have copied the last statement from the
Drummond MS. (1681), where the additional statement is made that Elizabeth’s
mother was Lucia, daughter of the Earl of Ross. (Genealogie of the
House of Drummond: Edinburgh, 1831, p. 237.) Both writers seem to have
confounded Malise, Earl of Stratherne, with his daughter’s son, Malise Sperra.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r171'>171</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There is a writ of Pope Innocent VI., dated in May 1360, preferring
Thomas to be bishop of the “Ecclesia Cathayensis,” and ordering him to
repair to his diocese on being consecrated by the Bishop of Preneste. It
appears from subsequent documents, however, that he was obstructed and
interfered with by the bishops of Limerick, Ardfert, and Clonmacnoise, who
laid many charges of criminal and illegal proceedings against him, asserting
that the “Ecclesia Cathayensis” was a parochial and not a cathedral church,
and the Pope appointed George, Archbishop of Cashel, to report on the matter.
Owing to the death of the archbishop the report was not made, and the remit
was renewed by the successor of Pope Innocent VI. to the Bishop of Lismore.
It is not clear whether this was a preferment to the see of Caithness following
on the death of Thomas de Fingask, or a series of mistakes. See Theiner’s
Vetera Monumenta, pp. 316, 318, 324.</p>

century, and is said by Wallace to have been built by Bishop Reid, in
all probability stands on the site of the older one. The veneration of
St. Olaf extended both to Scotland and England. There was a church
dedicated to him at Cruden, and among the articles enumerated in an
inventory of the treasury of the cathedral of Aberdeen in 1518, there
is “a small image of St. Olaf of silver decorated with precious
stones.”—(Regist. Episc. Aberdonense, ii. p. 172.)</p>

Ronaldsay, but gives no authority for the statement. The Saga, on the
other hand, states expressly that his remains were taken to Kirkwall,
and interred in the cathedral. It is not likely that the founder of
the cathedral would have been interred anywhere else.</p>

was born in Egilsey, and brought up there from his infancy, and that he gave
a piece of ground to his nurse, on which she made an underground house with
all its furniture of stone, it is plain that he is merely repeating the absurd traditions

indications of an earlier date, prevents our assigning to it a date later than the
beginning of the 12th century. When we contrast it with the Kirkwall
Cathedral begun in 1137, we are forced to give an earlier date than that to
Egilsey, and this opinion is corroborated by the churches at Orphir and
Brough of Birsay.”—(Ruined Churches in Orkney and Shetland, in the <i>Orcadian</i>
of 1867.)</p>

about 1115; Maplestead, 1118; the Temple Church, London, 1185; the
small Norman church in Ludlow Castle, and the Earls’ Church at Orphir in
Orkney—the only example in Scotland. “The round churches at Cambridge,
Northampton, and London,” says Ferguson, “were certainly sepulchral, or
erected in imitation of the church at Jerusalem” (History of Architecture,
ii. p. 60). Wilson, on the other hand, supposes that the early dry-built beehive
houses of the Western Islands may have served as a model for some of the
earliest Christian oratories, of which that at Orphir, he remarks, is an interesting
example (Prehistoric Annals, ii. p. 369). But there is no analogy whatever
between the architectural features of Orphir and those of the beehive
houses, nor has it any resemblance to the earlier oratories and chapels of the
Western Isles.</p>

resorted to in order to give a support to the centre on which the arch was
built. This seems highly probable, and in some cases it would seem as if the
original supports still remain in the shape of two long thin slabs resting on
the imposts on either side and meeting in the centre of the arch. See the

to be seen in the chapels at Lybster in Caithness, at Weir, at Linton in Shapinsay,
Uyea in Shetland, and in some of the early oratories in Ireland, and
suggests the question—Were there doors in these churches, and if so, where
were they placed and how were they hung? “It is known,” he adds, “that
in many cottages in old time the door was an animal’s hide hung across the
opening, and probably this may have been the case in these unrebated church
entrances.” The custom of closing the entrances to the places of worship by
a skin or heavy curtain survives in the East to the present day. The “veil
of the Temple,” covering the entrance to the Holy of Holies, is a familiar
illustration of this ancient custom among the Jews.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r233'>233</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dungad, called also Dungal, was a native chieftain, Maormor, or “Jarl,”
in the north-east corner of Caithness, who seems to have considered the policy
of conciliation preferable to that of resistance, judging from the intimate relations
he formed with the foreigners, marrying the daughter of one, and giving
his daughter in marriage to another, of the chiefs of the invaders. His <i>bœ</i> or
hamlet of residence became on this account so well known to the Norsemen,
that they named the district of Dungalsbae (now Duncansbay) by it, and spoke
of the headland (now Duncansbay Head) on which it was situated, as Dungalsness,
or Duncan’s cape. The supposed remains of his castle were seen by
Pennant in 1796, and are described by him as the ruins of a circular building,
in all probability one of the “burghs” or circular towers so common in the
north of Scotland, which seem to have been the defensive habitations of the
native Celtic or Pictish population of the period between the 6th and 9th or 10th
centuries. It is now a green mound. From the Session Records of the parish
it appears that the district retained its ancient name of “Dungasby” down to
the beginning of the last century, when it first appears as Duncansbay, and to
this day it is called “Dungsby” by the older inhabitants. The name of the
adjacent district of Canisbay, now applied to the whole parish, is similarly
derived from <i>Conan’s bæ</i>. It appears between 1223 and 1245 as Canenesbi
(Sutherland Charters), and in Blaeu’s Atlas, the MS. maps of which were
drawn (<i>circa</i> 1620), by Mr. Timothy Pont, the minister of the adjacent
parish of Dunnet, it is marked Conansbay. These two, Duncan and Conan,
are the only native chieftains of Caithness at the time of the Norse invasion
whose names have come down to us, probably because they were the only ones
who held friendly relations with the invaders.</p>

among the historians of Scotland to confound the <i>two</i> Malcolms, and to make
one of them, as if one Malcolm only (Malcolm II.) reigned from 1004 to 1034.
Though this theory has been ingeniously supported from a Norse point of
view, it is at variance with the concurrent testimony of the early Scottish
Chronicles. The Saga is the only authority for this marriage; but admitting
its testimony on this point to be unassailable scarcely necessitates the repudiation
of the authority of the Scottish Chronicles on the question of
the succession. (Compare Skene’s Highlanders, chap. 5; Robertson’s Scotland
under her Early Kings, vol. ii. p. 447; and Fordun (Skene’s edition), text and

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r238'>238</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The word <i>Bóndi</i> (pl. <i>Bœndr</i>), literally “a resident” or “dweller,” has no
English equivalent, although the form remains in the words “husband” and
“husbandman,” (hus-bondi, house-dweller or house-master). The Bœndr were
freeholders by odal tenure, proprietors of the lands which they had inherited by
succession from the original “land-takers.” “In the primitive form of
Scandinavian society,” says Balfour, in his Odal Rights and Feudal Wrongs,
“land was the only wealth, its ownership the sole foundation of power,
privilege, or dignity. As no man could win or hold possession without the
strong arm to defend it, every landowner was a warrior, every warrior a
husbandman. King Sigurd Syr tended his own hay harvest, and Sweyn of
Gairsay and Thorkel Fóstri swept the coasts of Britain or Ireland while the
crops which they and their rovers had sown grew ready for their reaping.”
The use of the ancient term survived in Orkney till 1529, as we learn from
the description by Jo. Ben, that in the parish of Rendale the people saluted
each other with “Goand da boundæ” (i.e. <i>godan dag bondi!</i>) instead of the
“Guid day, gudeman,” of the Scottish vernacular. Among the documents
found in the king’s treasury at Edinburgh in 1282, was one entitled “A quit-claiming
of the lands of the <i>bondi</i> of Caithness for the slaughter of the Bishop,”—viz.
Bishop Adam, who was burned at Halkirk in 1222 by the “<i>bondi</i>,” exasperated
by his exactions. Although the word is Icelandic, it has been retained
in the translation as a convenient term to designate the class, in preference to
such periphrastic renderings as “farmer-lairds,” “peasant proprietors,” or
“peasant nobles,” as are usually employed.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r239'>239</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Hrossey (Horse Isle) was the name given by the Norsemen to the mainland
of the Orkney group. The Sandvik here mentioned as the residence of
Amundi and Thorkel can only be the Sandvik (now Sandwick) on Deerness.
When Thorfinn drew his vessels in under Deerness before he was attacked by
Kali Hundason (chap. v.), he sent to Thorkel asking him to collect men and
come to his assistance. Thorkel’s residence could not therefore have been far
from Deerness, although the mention of Laufandaness is somewhat suggestive
of Lopness in Sanday.</p>

identification of this Lough as the scene of Earl Einar’s defeat, that Norse
burials have been discovered at Larne. One of these is described in the

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r252'>252</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The identity of Karl or Kali Hundason is one of the historical puzzles
which exercise the ingenuity of modern historians. Supposing the Saga name
of this individual to be a Norse corruption of the name of a Scottish king, it
resembles none more nearly than that of Culen Induffson, the Culen Mac
Induff of the <i>Chronica Pictorum</i>. But if Kali Hundason be intended for
Culen Induffson, the dates do not agree by more than sixty years. On the
other hand, supposing the events here narrated to be of the period assigned to
them by the Saga, Kali Hundason ought to be Duncan, son of Crinan, Abbot
of Dunkeld, who was the grandson and successor of King Malcolm Mac Kenneth.
But Fordun states that Duncan’s succession was a peaceful one. It is
not to be overlooked, however, that Earl Thorfinn was also a grandson of
Malcolm Mac Kenneth; and if we could account for the discrepancy as to the
name given by the Saga, the war between the two grandsons of the deceased
monarch might readily be accounted for. For full details of the speculations
regarding the identity of Kali Hundason, see Skene’s Highlanders of
Scotland, chap. v.; the Irish version of “Nennius” (Irish Archæological
Society), Appendix, p. 78; Robertson’s Scotland under her Early Kings, vol.

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r253'>253</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The words “at Beruvik” in Jonæus’s edition are not in the Flateyjarbók.
Two places of this name are mentioned in the Saga. One of these is plainly
Berwick-on-Tweed (chap. xcii.) The locality of the other (which must be the
“Beruvik” of this passage) is fixed by the statement in chap. xciv., where it
is said that Earl Rögnvald was then in Sutherland celebrating the marriage
of his daughter with Eirik Slagbrellir; and when word was brought to him
that Harald had come to Thurso, he rode with a number of his followers
“from Beruvik to Thurso.” It has been conjectured that the place here
indicated was <i>Caistal a Bharruick</i>, an old square tower situated on an
eminence near Kirkiboll, on the east side of the shore of the Kyle of Tongue
(<i>Orig. Parochiales</i>, vol. ii. p. 717). Judging from the context, however, it
seems more likely that it may have been the <i>vik</i> or inlet at the mouth of the
water of Berriedale (Berudal), on the southern border of Caithness, where
there are also the ruins of an old square tower—the Castle of Berriedale.
This agrees with the statement that King Kali, sailing <i>northward</i> from Beruvik,
saw the sails of Thorfinn’s ships going towards Deerness, as he sailed into
the mouth of the Firth from the east. Had Kali come from the Kyle of
Tongue, he would have sailed <i>east</i>, and Thorfinn would have seen and intercepted
him from Duncansbay.</p>

Ekkiálsbakká, or the district along the banks of the Oikel and its estuary—the
Kyle of Sutherland—which formed the march between the territory of the
Norse earls and Scotland. Torfness may thus be conjectured to be Tarbatness,
although we have nothing to fix the locality more definitely. Bæfiord,
in this case, would be the wider portion of the Dornoch Firth. Munch suggests
that the seemingly French name of Beaufort Castle may be a corruption
of Bæfiord (which in that case would be the Beauly Frith); but in all probability
the name Beaufort is what it seems to be, and much more modern.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r267'>267</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Gaddgedlar.—This passage has given rise to a variety of conjectures.
None of the explanations which have yet been offered are free from difficulties.
Munch (<i>Chronicon Manniæ</i>, p. 46) says that, considering the situation of
Caithness, and how well the author of the saga must have known it, it
becomes evident that between “Caithness” and “at the place” an <i>and</i> must
have been dropped by the subsequent writer, who, living about <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1380, and
in Iceland (this part of the saga existing only in the <i>Codex Flateyensis</i>), might
easily have dropped an <i>ok</i> (or the abbreviation thereof), not conscious of the
great blunder he committed. He further adds that Gaddgedlar is evidently
the Norse corruption of “Galwydia,” Galloway. This explanation is open to
the objections that, besides the improbability of Thorfinn having dwelt for the
most part in Caithness and in Galloway, the latter place does not fit the description
that there Scotland and England meet. The word <i>eingland</i>, signifying
meadow, or strath land, may possibly have been used as a general term for
“The Dales of Caithness,” if it may not be supposed to be a mis-transcription
of the word <i>eignarland</i>, meaning Thorfinn’s own territory. Gaddgedlar might
be the Norse pronunciation of the native word Gall-gael, applied to the mixed
population of the districts where the Norse element had not entirely displaced
the Celtic, or the border districts between the Norse earldom and the purely
Celtic territory “where Scotland and his (Thorfinn’s) own land meet.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c028' id='f268'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r268'>268</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Raudabiorg, or Red Headland, must be looked for in the neighbourhood
of Dunnet Head, where the red beds of the Old Red Sandstone form the distinctive
feature of the coast. A little to the east of Dunnet Head there is an
outlying crag named Brough of Rattar, or Rattar Brough—in all probability
a corrupted form of the old name Raudabiorg. Still farther to the eastward,
where the burn of Rattar enters the Firth, are the ruins of an old “Pictish
tower,” or broch—in old Norse, <i>borg</i>. In its immediate vicinity is a little
promontory called Kirk o’ Taing (<i>Kirkiu Tunga</i>, the Tongue, or Ness of the
Kirk), on which are the ruins of one of the small rudely-built chapels of the
early Christian time. On the north side of the chapel the edges of a number
of stone cists are visible through the turf; and from two of these, which were
dug up in cutting a drain in the spring of 1872, eight silver armlets of the
ancient penannular form were obtained. These correspond exactly with the
armlets which formed part of the great hoard exhumed at Skaill, in Orkney,
on the opposite side of the Firth, with Cufic and Anglo-Saxon coins of the
tenth century—in all probability a hoard deposited by some of the vikings on
their return from a plundering expedition. As Earl Thorfinn and his men
were Christians, it seems probable that, if the chapel was then in existence,
the bodies of the seventy slain in the fight off Raudabiorg, which were landed
here, would be buried in the consecrated ground attached to this chapel.</p>

Papey minni), now Papa Westray and Papa Stronsay, are both mentioned in
the Saga. Fordun, in his enumeration of the islands, has a “Papeay tertia,”
which is not now known. There are three islands in Shetland called Papey,
and both in Orkney and Shetland there are several districts named Paplay or
Papplay, doubtless the same as the Papyli of Iceland. Munch considers that
these names betray a Kelto-Christian origin.  They probably indicate the
settlements of Irish ecclesiastics in the islands previous to the arrival of the
Northmen. The recent discoveries in Orkney of ecclesiastical bells of the
early square form, and of stone monuments with Ogham inscriptions (in one
case associated with a figure of the cross of an early form), seem to point to
the settlement of ecclesiastical communities in the islands at a very early
period. (See <a href='#h2-intro'>Introduction</a>.)</p>

year 1050. King Magnus died in <span class='fss'>A.D</span>. 1047, and some time must have elapsed
before Thorfinn heard of his death.  Then his messengers went to Norway,
and returned; and his own expedition was thereafter prepared. After
visiting King Harald Hardradi in Norway, he stayed some time with Svend
Estridson, the King of Denmark. Then he visited Henry III., Emperor of
Germany, and would probably reach Rome soon after the accession of Pope
Leo IX., who occupied the Papal throne from 1049 to 1055. As Macbeth,
the only Scottish sovereign who ever visited the city of Rome, made his
pilgrimage thither in the year 1050, and Thorfinn and he were close friends and
allies, it is probable that they went together. (Compare Saga of King Harald

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r283'>283</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This marriage is unknown in Scottish history, and rests on the authority
of the Sagas alone. Duncan is said by the Scottish historians to have been a
bastard, while the Sagas make him the legitimate offspring of Malcolm and
Ingibiorg, who must by this time have been old enough to be Malcolm’s
mother. She was married to Earl Thorfinn before Kálf Arnason was banished
by King Magnus (chap. xiv.), which was some time between 1036 and 1041.
Earl Thorfinn died in 1064, seven years after King Malcolm was crowned at
Scone, in 1057. Malcolm’s marriage with the Princess Margaret of England
took place in 1067, or less than three years after Ingibiorg became a widow.
Munch supposes that Ingibiorg must have died in childbed with Duncan, and
suggests that the fact that Duncan claimed the crown before Edgar, the son
of Malcolm by Margaret, may be taken as showing that he must have been
the offspring of a previous marriage. Macpherson (Wyntoun, vol. ii. p. 472),
while accepting the statement of the Saga, accounts for Duncan being called a
bastard from the circumstance that Malcolm’s marriage with Ingibiorg was
within the degrees of propinquity forbidden by the canon law.</p>

The reference here to him as the person whom all the Scots wished to
have for their king is explained by the fact that, on the death of David I., by
the old Celtic law of succession, he became in the eyes of the Celtic population
the rightful heir to the throne; and his claims were supported by no fewer
than seven Earls, among whom were those of Strathern, Ross, and Orkney.
The insurrection was speedily put down, but the claim was subsequently
revived by Donald Bane Macwilliam, who, on the same principle, obtained the
support of the northern chiefs.  (See Skene’s Highlanders of Scotland for a

Griffith was at that time engaged in war with the Norman Earls above mentioned,

of the reigning monarch, Edgar MacMalcolm. Malcolm Canmore
died in 1093, the year of King Magnus’s first expedition to the west. The
second expedition, which was in 1098, was the one in which he fought with
the two Norman Earls in Anglesea Sound. The events of the two expeditions
are here mixed up together, and the references to Malcolm Canmore do not
synchronise with either. It is possible that the offer of the islands (as here
mentioned) may have come to King Magnus from Donald Bane, the brother
of King Malcolm, to secure the support of King Magnus in his attempt to retain
the throne against Edgar, although the incident of the drawing of the boat across
the isthmus may have taken place in the reign of Edgar. The “Fagrskinna”
(p. 156) adds that King Malcolm of Scotland, sent his daughter out to the
Orkneys to be married to Magnus’s son Sigurd, he being then nine and she
five years of age, and that he left her in the Orkneys when he went to Norway.
The author has confounded Malcolm with Mýrkiartan.</p>

of the Mainland of Shetland, so named by the Norsemen on account of the
“borg,” or “Pictish tower,” which still stands on the little holm of Hebrista,
though greatly ruined. It is probable that the reason of Thorbiörn’s connection
with Borgarfiord was its affording him and his followers a shelter and
defensive position in the borg. The old name Borgarfiord occurs in a document
in the Norse language dated 1299. It is a record drawn up in the
Lagthing of certain charges made against Herr Thorvald Thoresson, by a
woman named Ragnhild Simonsdatter, who accuses him of malversation of the
land-rents of Brekasettr. (<i>Diplom. Norvegicum</i>, vol. i. p. 81.) Harald of

indicated. Stennis has been suggested, on the supposition that the great
stone circle there would have been thus utilised by the Northmen. It does
not appear, however, that the occasion on which Havard, son of Thorfinn
Hausakliuf, was killed at “Steinsness” was a Thing meeting there, and this
is the only occasion on which Stennis is mentioned in the whole of the
Flateyjarbók. “Tingwale,” in the parish of Rendale, occurs in the Orkney
Land List of 1502. This seems to be the only trace of the old Thing-völl in

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r301'>301</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Egilsey, in Jo. Ben’s description of the Orkneys (1529) called “Insularum
Ecclesia,” is regarded by Munch as deriving its name not from the Norse
proper name <i>Egil</i>, but from the Irish <i>Eaglais</i>, a church. “To this day,” he
says, “Egilsey contains a church shown by its construction to have been built
before the Northmen arrived in Orkney, or at all events to belong to the more
ancient Christian Celtic population. (See under “<a href='#h3-X'>Egilsey</a>” in the Introduction).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c028' id='f302'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r302'>302</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>These dates are self-contradictory, and utterly irreconcilable. King
Magnus Barelegs fell in Ireland in the year 1103; and it is stated in the Saga
of Sigurd, the Jorsala-farer, that Hákon, Paul’s son, came to Norway to King
Sigurd “a year or two after King Magnus’s fall.” The King gave him the
earldom and government of the Orkneys, and he went back immediately to
Orkney. Then it is added that four years after the fall of King Magnus—that
is, in 1107—King Sigurd set out on his pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Now, it is
mentioned in this Saga (chap. <a href='#ch-xxxiii'>xxxiii</a>.) that Earl Magnus went to Norway to see
King Eystein, “for King Sigurd had then gone to Jerusalem.” This must
have been after 1107. King Eystein gave him his patrimony, one-half of the
Orkneys. If his visit to Norway was in the year after King Sigurd’s departure,
as seems likely from the narrative, or in 1108, and “he had been seven
winters Earl in the Orkneys along with Earl Hákon,” this would bring the
date of his death exactly to the year assigned in the Iceland Annals appended
to the Flateyjarbók, or to 1115. The entry in the “Annalar” for that year
is: “Pindr enn heilagi Magnus jarl i Orkneyium.” Torfæus dates this event
in 1110. The Saga of St. Magnus says he had been twelve winters Earl of the
Orkneys jointly with Hákon, counting evidently from the vacancy of
earldom in 1103 by the accession of Sigurd, Magnus’ son, then Earl of the
Orkneys, to the throne of Norway. This also gives the date 1115.</p>

<div class='footnote c028' id='f303'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r303'>303</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A curious catalogue of cases in which diseased and infirm people were
miraculously restored to health and vigour, after paying their vows at the
shrine of St. Magnus, is given in the Magnus Saga. These pilgrims mostly
came from Shetland. Two of the cases are interesting as affording the earliest
notices of leprosy (<i>líkthrá</i>) in Shetland—a disease which seems to have continued
in the Islands till towards the close of the last century.—(Sir James
Simpson’s Archæological Essays—Leprosy and Leper Hospitals in Britain.)
These cases appear to have been overlooked by Sir James. Schröder has published
a curious Swedish version of the story of St. Magnus, in which the
account of his miracles is considerably varied.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c028' id='f304'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r304'>304</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That is for sixty-six years. As William died, according to the Icelandic
Annals, in 1168, and was bishop in the year of St. Magnus’s death, 1115,
he was undoubtedly bishop for fifty-three years. That he was bishop for the
long period of sixty-six years, as this passage seems to imply, may be open to
some doubt. Munch supposes that the “seventh decade” may be an error
for “sixth.” This would place his consecration to the see of Orkney in 1112;
but the Saga of St. Magnus says he was bishop sixty-six years.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r306'>306</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Sigurd Slembir or Slembidiakn had a most romantic history. In his
youth he was considered the son of a priest, Adalbrekt by name, and was
brought up for the church. His tastes appear to have lain in quite another
direction, however; and he soon broke loose from the restraints of ecclesiastical
life. He gave himself out as an illegitimate son of King Magnus Barelegs,
and commenced a life of roving and adventure, visiting the Holy Land, and
turning an honest penny occasionally by trading expeditions to Scotland, the
Orkneys, Ireland, and Denmark. In the latter country he proved his paternity
by the ordeal of hot iron, as King Harald Gilli had done. He then
went to King Harald, and asked him to recognise him; but instead of this
he was placed on his trial for the slaying of Thorkel Fóstri, Sumarlidi’s son.
He managed to make his escape by jumping overboard with two of his guards
in his arms, and soon after returned and killed King Harald Gilli in his bed
in Bergen. Then he tried to place Magnus the Blind on the throne by assistance
from Denmark; but the expedition was met on the south coast of Norway
by the sons of King Harald, and totally defeated.  Magnus was slain,
and Sigurd Slembir was taken, and put to death with almost incredible tortures.
(See the account of him in the Sagas of Magnus the Blind and the
sons of Harald in the Heimskringla.)</p>

<div class='footnote c028' id='f319'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r319'>319</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Harald Gillichrist, illegitimate son of King Magnus Barelegs, was of
Celtic extraction, his mother being a native of the Hebrides. He and his
mother were brought over to Norway from the Southern Hebrides in a ship
belonging to a Norwegian merchant named Halkel Húk. When the story of
Harald’s parentage was told to King Sigurd, he consented to allow Harald to
prove his paternity by the ordeal of hot iron, but on condition, that if he succeeded
in proving his descent according to his claim, he should not desire the
kingdom in the lifetime either of King Sigurd or of his son, King Magnus,
and to this Harald bound himself by oath. This seems to be the oath referred
to as given under compulsion. “The ordeal,” it is added in the Saga of King
Sigurd, “was the greatest ever made in Norway, for nine glowing ploughshares
were laid down, and Harald walked over them with bare feet, attended
by two bishops, and invoking the holy St. Columba”—another testimony to
his Celtic birth. His feet were then bound up, and he was laid in bed.
After the customary three days had elapsed, his feet were examined, or, as the
Saga has it, “the ordeal was taken to proof, and his feet were found unburnt.”
His claims were therefore held to have been proven, and made good. It is
curious to find that among the privileges granted by the Scottish King David
to the monks of Holyrood, they were specially empowered to make trials by the
ordeal of hot iron.</p>

ships of another Viking lying on the opposite side of an island on the
coast of Sweden, he spent the whole night in landing the goods and
plunder from his vessels, and breaking up stones, and loading his
vessel with them to serve as missiles in the attack. The same thing

of which the main hall or skáli answered to the public room of the residence.
The descriptions given of the Orkney skális are wanting in that
minuteness which is necessary to enable us to understand the details of their
construction. No doubt they were similar to those of Iceland, the larger of
which were constructed partly of stone and partly of timber, the middle division
of the hall being higher in the roof than the “aisles” on either side of it, and
separated from them by a row of pillars running parallel to each of the side
walls. The walls of the aisles and the spaces between the pillars were covered
with wainscoting, sometimes with carved work, and on high days hung with
tapestry. Shields and weapons were hung along the sides of the hall, above
the benches, and the fires were lit on hearths in the middle of the floor. The
benches were ranged along both sides of the hall; the “high seat” of the
Earl, or owner of the skáli, was in the centre of the south side, and the seats
of highest honour were those next to him on either side.</p>

Scandinavian form), and other relics unquestionably of Norse origin, shows
that the neighbourhood must have been largely frequented by the Northmen,

yet the fact of Earl Rögnvald turning the procession into ridicule,
whereas Bishop John’s party appear to have been received with all due respect,
suggests that the two narratives can scarcely refer to the same incident. The
reference here to the “isle Elon,” taken in connection with the statement in
chap. xcix. that there were monks on Eller Holm (named “Helene-holm” by
Fordun), may mean that there was a colony of clerics on the little island,
whose dress and tonsure may thus have tickled the fancy of the rhyming Earl.
In the rental of Shapinsay (1642), Elgin-holme is set in feu to Sir John
Buchanan for payment of 12s. annually. In 1529 Jo. Ben mentions that there
were foundations of houses and even of a chapel on Eloerholme, though it was

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r344'>344</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Still known as the Swelkie, a dangerous whirlpool in certain states of
the tide, off the island of Stroma, fabled to be caused by the waters being
sucked down through the eye of the quern “Grotti,” which once belonged to
King Fródi. Grotti was found in Denmark, and was the largest quern that
had ever been known.  It would grind for King Fródi gold or peace, which
he pleased. But the sea-king M['y]sing took Grotti, and caused white salt to
be ground in his ships till they sank in Pentland’s Firth. This is why the
Swelkie has been there ever since. As the waters fall through the eye of the
quern, the sea roars as the quern grinds; and, moreover, this is how the sea
first became salt.—(Elder Edda, Grottasöng.) Traces of this legend still linger
in the locality.</p>

<div class='footnote c028' id='f345'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r345'>345</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Ekkialsbakki is three times mentioned in the Flateyjarbók, and Ekkial
once by Arnór Jarlaskáld (see p. <a href='#Page_22'>22</a>). Earl Sigurd, Eystein’s son, who killed
Malbrigd (Maormor of Mar according to Skene), was “hoy-laid” (buried in a
how or barrow, <i>haugr</i>), on Ekkialsbakki. “There cannot be the least doubt,”
says Worsaae, in his ‘Danes and Northmen,’ “that Ekkial is the river Oykill
(Oykel), which still forms the southern boundary of Sutherland. But nobody
is able to point out the barrow of Sigurd Jarl.  The tradition relating to it
has vanished with the Norwegian population.”  But, fortunately, there are
records more permanent and reliable than popular tradition, by which the
truth of the Saga narrative may be verified, and the locality of Sigurd’s
grave-mound indisputably fixed.  There is a place near the Ferry on the
north bank of the Dornoch Firth (into which the Oykel runs) which is now
somewhat inappropriately called Cyder Hall.  In Blaeu’s Atlas (1640) it
appears as Siddera. In older charters it is conjoined with Skebo, and called
Sythera. In a deed of the year 1275 the Bishop of Caithness claims right to
“six davochs of Schythebolle and Sytheraw, with the ferry.” In the deed of
constitution of the Cathedral Chapter of Caithness, executed between 1223
and 1245, there are assigned to the treasurer the rectorial tithes of Scytheboll
and <i>Siwardhoch</i>, its conjunction with Scytheboll showing it to be the same
place which is called at subsequent periods Sytheraw, Siddera, and Cyder
Hall. This place, named Siward’s Hoch (<i>Sigurd’s haug</i>) at that early date,
could be no other than the traditional site of Earl Sigurd’s grave-mound,
and the Ekkialsbakki on which he was buried must thus have been the
north bank of the Oykel’s estuary.  But the Ekkialsbakki twice mentioned
in connection with Swein Asleifson’s journey to Athole can scarcely be the
same with that of the earlier narrative. It seems probable that in Swein
Asleifson’s narrative the word may have been originally Atjoklsbakki—the
coast on the side of the Breidafiord (Moray Firth) next to Atjöklar (Athole).
The word <i>bakki</i> is sometimes used for a “coast.” The Saga writer may have
been misled by the similarity of sound to substitute Ekkialsbakki for Atjoklsbakki.

as Maddoc, Madach, and Madeth. In the foundation-charter of Scone by
King Alexander I. and his queen Sibilla, “Madach Comes” is a witness.
“Maddoc” and “Madeth Comes” also witness charters of King David I. From
a charter by King Malcolm the Maiden, granting aid for the restoration of the
Abbey of Scone, we learn that the style of the Earls of Athole was “Comes
de Ethocl,” the Atjokl of the Saga.—(Regist. de Dunferm. Regist. de Scone.)</p>

Borgar lived at Knarrarstad, which is evidently the name for the district,
while Geitaberg was the name of Borgar’s homestead. Gatnip is the highest

transferred to it from Christ’s Church, in Birsay, previous to the departure of
Earl Rögnvald to the Holy Land in 1152. After Earl Rögnvald’s death, in
1158, the building of the cathedral was carried on by Bishop William, until
his death in 1168, after which we have no record of its progress.</p>

Harfagri in the time of the Earl Torf Einar. Earl Sigurd Hlödverson restored
the odal rights in return for the assistance of the Bœndr at the battle

of the succession-dues by Earl Rögnvald, which were subsequently bought

<div class='footnote c028' id='f351'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r351'>351</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Knarrarstad, as has been formerly explained, was applied to the district
at the head of the Bay of Scapa. It was so called because it was the place
where the merchant-ships lay—from <i>Knarrar</i>, genitive of <i>knörr</i>, a merchant-ship;
and <i>stadr</i>, a stance or stead. The name is preserved in old estate-lists
as <i>Knarstane</i>. In the near neighbourhood there is an ancient “broch” or
“Pictish tower,” recently excavated by Mr. George Petrie. Remains of very
extensive buildings have been found within and around it, evidently belonging
to a secondary occupation of the tower, of later date than that of its
original construction. Among the relics found in these secondary buildings
there are some which correspond with relics of the later Viking period found
in Scandinavia. This gives a certain amount of probability to the supposition
that the ruins of this “Pictish tower” may have been occupied and utilised
by Earl Rögnvald’s men, as we know that the similar tower of Mousa, in
Shetland, was on different occasions, one of which is narrated in chap. xcii. of
this same Saga.</p>

historians of the period inform us, was composed of natives of the remote
north, whom they call Varangians. The name Varangi first appears with them
in the year 935, but they are said to have served of old in the body-guard, and
to have come partly from Thule and partly from England. In the Saga of
Harald Hardradi his exploits during his sojourn in the East are minutely
detailed, and it is recorded that he became chief of the Værings, who were
at that time in the Imperial service. For several centuries these mercenaries
in the pay of the Emperors were renowned for their bravery, discipline, and
fidelity. After the Norman conquest of England, a body of Anglo-Saxon
youth, under Siward of Gloucester, choosing exile rather than the ignominy
of submission to the conquerors, went to Constantinople, and enrolled
themselves among the Værings. So many followed them that a mixture of
Danish and Saxon became the official language of the guards of the Imperial
Palace. Hoards of Eastern coins and ornaments are almost annually discovered
in Norway and Sweden, and occasionally in Orkney and the North of
Scotland. The museum of Stockholm possesses a collection of more than
20,000 Cufic coins found in Sweden, dating from the close of the 8th to the
end of the 10th century, and vast quantities of those silver ornaments of peculiar
forms and style of workmanship, which are also believed to have been brought

thee there. On the edge of the river-bank there was a bush of willows, and
there I twisted a knot of willows, which is waiting thee there; for I said this
knot thou shouldst untie, and fulfil the vow, brother, that is bound up in it.”

Careston, which lies on the inlet leading to the Loch of Stennis, a little to the
north-east of Stromness. But this would make Arni, Rafn’s son, run a good
ten miles without once remembering that he had his shield on his shoulder
until it stuck in the door at Kirkwall. If this Kjarekstad be not the same
with Knarrarstad at Scapa, which was Earl Rögnvald’s homestead (see p. <a href='#Page_113'>113</a>),
and might be the castle here spoken of, there is a Carness near Kirkwall (in
old maps Carisness) which may be more readily supposed to be the Kjarekstad
from which Arni ran than Careston near Stromness.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r404'>404</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Munch says of this passage that the text reads, very improperly, “Gáreksey”
for “Grimsey.” Hafnarvag he identifies with the Medalland’s hofn of
Hakon Hakonson’s saga, which is the “Midland Harbour” lying between the
Holm of Houston and the Mainland on the south side of Orphir. The name
Hafnarvag, however, simply signifies a landing-place in a voe or inlet, and
might more appropriately be applied to some place near the head of the inlet
immediately opposite Grimsey, which goes up to the Loch of Stennis. If
Harald and his men landed at “Midland Harbour,” they took the longest
land route to walk to Firth; if they landed near the head of the inlet above
mentioned, they chose the shortest land route.</p>

<div class='footnote c028' id='f405'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r405'>405</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The word Orkahaug is only known to occur twice—once here, and once
in one of the Runic inscriptions on the walls of the chamber of Maeshow.
Here it is given merely as the name of the place where Earl Harald and his
men had a Yule-tide carouse, which disabled two of them from proceeding on
their journey, so that they failed in surprising Earl Erlend at his Yule feast.
In the inscription in the chamber of Maeshow it appears as the name of the
burial-mound which was broken into by the Jorsala-farers in search of treasure.
There seems to be little doubt that this name “Orkahaug” was the name by
which the Maeshow was then known. The Orkahaug of the text must either
mean the actual “how” itself, or a homestead near it which was named from
it. There is an Orkhill (Orquill) not very far from Maeshow, and there was
another Orkhill near Knarstane, Scapa, which is called Orquile in “the
coppie of my Lord Sinclairis Rentale that deit at Flowdin.” No other Orkahaug,
however, is known. (See under Maeshow in the Introduction.)</p>

the year <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1159, we learn from the more trustworthy sources of Fordun and
the Chron. de Mailros that Somerled was killed at Renfrew on the 1st January
1164, having landed there with a fleet of 160 galleys in the attempt to make
a conquest of Scotland. He had given his sister in marriage to Wimund, ex-bishop,
<i>alias</i> Malcolm M’Heth, whom the Saga calls Earl of Moray. After
the unsuccessful termination of Malcolm M’Heth’s attempt to gain possession
of the crown of Scotland, his brother-in-law, Somerled, seems to have continued
the hostilities against King David, and to have joined the party against
Malcolm IV. when the attempt was made to place the “Boy of Egremont”
on the throne. (See Fordun Skene’s ed.) II. 250, and Munch, <i>Chron. Man.</i>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r441'>441</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In reference to this passage, Jonæus, in his edition of the Saga (Hafniæ,
1780), says, that what is of the greatest moment is the fact which it points
out, that at this date (circa 1158) there were reindeer in Scotland. In his
Latin version of the original he translates the phrase “<i>at veida rauddyri edr
hreina</i>” as “<i>feras rubras et rangiferos venari</i>,” and has no doubt or hesitancy
about the matter. It is established by geological evidence that the reindeer
was widely distributed in Great Britain in post-glacial times, although the
instances of its occurrence within the human period, and in association with
the remains of man, have been comparatively rare. Recently, however, evidence
has been supplied by excavations in the ruins of the brochs, or “Pictish
towers,” of the north of Scotland, which fully corroborates the statement of
the Saga that the reindeer was actually hunted and eaten by the later occupants
of these structures, their latest occupation on record being an occasional
one by the Norsemen. In the refuse-heaps of several of these towers, the horns
of the reindeer have been found, in some instances cut and sawn as if to be
utilised for artificial purposes; while in other cases it is evident that the
animals must have been killed when the horns were in the velvet. It is also
significant that the reindeer moss (<i>Cladonia rangiferina</i>) still grows abundantly
in Caithness. The question is very fully and ably discussed in a paper
on “The Reindeer in Scotland,” by Dr. J. A. Smith, in the eighth volume of
the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c028' id='f442'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r442'>442</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is plain from the original that some words are here omitted from the
text. One of the MS. copies of the Saga has had the additional words, which
are thus rendered in the Danish translation preserved at Stockholm, “<i>Der
som vaar noget</i> erg, <i>det kalde vi setter</i>,” etc. “There were there some shielings
(erg), which we call setter; and there they took up their quarters for the
night.” What is remarkable about this passage is that the Gaelic word for a
shieling, <i>Airidh</i>, given phonetically by the old Norse saga-writer as “erg,” is
glossed in the Danish translation by the word “setter”—summer pasturing-place,
where rude huts were erected for temporary occupation. The word
setter, which is common in the place-names of Caithness and the Northern
Isles, is to this day understood by the inhabitants in the same sense, although
the custom of sending the cattle to the hill-pastures in summer, and living
in “shielings,” has now ceased, on the mainland at least. (See also the note

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r445'>445</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The word <i>ærgin</i> is not Norse. It is, however, a Norse corruption of the
Gaelic word for a shieling—<i>airidh</i>, plur. <i>aridhean</i>, which enters into the
composition of many of the place-names in Caithness—<i>e.g.</i> Halsary, Dorrery,
Shurrery, Blingery, etc. Asgrim’s <i>ærgin</i> is still recognisable in the modern
Askary or Assary, near the north end of the Loch of Calder. It is curious to
find thus incidentally in the Saga an indication of the blending of the folk-speech
of the time, and to find also in the modern names of Norn Calder and
Scotscalder a record (preserved on the spot) of the time when one portion of
the dale was possessed by the Norsemen and another by the natives. Passing
from Calder towards the coast the place-names are mostly Norse; and passing
from Calder in the opposite direction towards the uplands, the place-names
are almost entirely Gaelic.</p>

first as Wimund, a monk of Savigny, and priest in the Isle of Skye. Afterwards
he became Bishop of Man, and subsequently appeared in the character
of a pretender to the Scottish crown, giving himself out to be Malcolm MacHeth,
son of that Angus MacHeth who was defeated by King David, and
slain at Strickathro <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1130.  Assisted by Somerled of Argyle and by this
alliance with the Earl of Orkney, he ravaged the western coasts of Scotland,
until he was captured by King David, and confined in the Castle of Roxburgh
in 1134. He was released by Malcolm the Maiden after the death of King
David, and received from the young king the sovereignty of a portion of the
ancient kingdom of Cumbria. His tyranny was such that his subjects revolted,
took him prisoner, put out his eyes, and confined him in the monastery
of Bellaland (Byland), in Yorkshire. (Munch, <i>Chron. Man.</i> p. 80.)</p>

there is nothing to fix the locality of this battle more definitely. The tradition
of the district points to Clairdon Hill, between Murkle and Thurso,
as the scene of the encounter. The church which is here said to have been
erected on the spot where Harald fell, and which is spoken of as standing
there when the Saga was written, is not now in existence. The ruins of a
chapel, which was traditionally believed to mark the spot, were removed when
the ground was brought under cultivation by the late Sir John Sinclair. A
remonstrance by the late Rev. Mr. Pope, of Reay, seems to have had the effect
of causing the erection of an edifice (now used as the tomb of the Sinclair
family) over the place where an old chapel stood. It is now known locally
as “Harold’s Tower.” Large quantities of human bones, and several of the
peculiarly-shaped Norse swords which Mr. Pope describes as “odd machines

There is a chapel dedicated to St. Tredwell in the island of Papa Westray,
which Munch considers likely to have been erected by Celtic ecclesiastics previous
to the Norse invasion. There was another chapel dedicated to her at
Kintradwell, in Sutherlandshire, where she is known as St. Trullen; but there
is now no trace of a St. Tredwell’s chapel in Caithness.</p>

prescribing the penance to be performed by the man Lomberd, who cut
out the Bishop’s tongue, gives the additional information that when
the Earl’s men took the “borg” they killed almost all that were in it.
(See the <a href='#h2-intro'>Introduction</a>.) The “borg,” or castle, at Scrabster, may have
been an earlier building on the site of the “Bishop’s Castle,” an old
fortalice on the cliff near the present hamlet of Scrabster, or it may
have been the ruins of one of the still older Pictish towers, not far
off, which the Caithnessmen may have occupied for the occasion as a
defensible position.</p>

1222, and add that the King of Scots caused the hands and feet to be hewn
off eighty men who had been concerned in the Bishop’s burning. Among the
documents found in the King’s treasury at Edinburgh in 1282 (and subsequently
lost) was one entitled: “A quit-claiming of the lands of the Bondi of
Caithness for the slaughter of the Bishop.” A bull of Pope Honorius, dated
23d January 1223, and addressed to the Bishops of St. Andrews, Glasgow,
Dunkeld, and Dunblane, speaks in terms of high commendation of King
Alexander’s zealous desire to avenge such an unheard-of crime as the burning
of a bishop, and thoroughly corroborates the Saga account of the manner of
Adam’s death, stating that these “wolves” and “demons,” having stripped
their Bishop of his garments, stoned him, mortally wounded him with an axe,
and finally burned him in his own kitchen. (Theiner’s <i>Vetera Monumenta</i>,
p. 21.)</p>

8vo. Price 3s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c034'>“Since these lectures were published there has appeared an exceedingly
interesting volume, entitled ‘Colloquia Peripatetica,’ by the late John Duncan,
LL.D., Professor of Hebrew in the New College, Edinburgh. These Colloquies are
reported by the Rev. William Knight, who seems to be admirably adapted for the
task he has undertaken. His friend must have been a man of rare originality,
varied culture, great vigour in expressing thoughts, which were worthy to be expressed
and remembered.... The reader who shall give himself the
benefit and gratification of studying this short volume (it will suggest more to him
than many of ten times its size) will find that I have not been bribed to speak well
of it by any praise which Dr. Duncan has bestowed on me. The only excuse for
alluding to it is, that it contains the severest censure on my writings which they
have ever incurred, though they have not been so unfortunate as to escape censure....
Against any ordinary criticism, even a writer who is naturally
thin-skinned becomes by degrees tolerably hardened. One proceeding from a man
of such learning and worth as Dr. Duncan I have thought it a duty to notice.”—<i>Extract

<p class='c008'>Ninth Edition. Crown 8vo, price 6s.</p>

<p class='c040'>“This is a very remarkable volume of sermons. And it is no doubt a most
favourable symptom of the healthiness of Christian thought among us, that we
are so often able to begin a notice with these words.</p>

<p class='c040'>“We cannot help wishing that such notice more frequently introduced to our
readers a volume of Church of England sermons. Still, looking beyond our pale,
we rejoice notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c040'>“Mr. Ker has dug boldly and diligently into the vein which Robertson opened;
but the result, as compared with that of the first miner, is as the product of skilled
machinery set against that of the vigorous unaided arm. There is no roughness,
no sense of labour; all comes smoothly and regularly on the page—one thought
evoked out of another. As Robertson strikes the rock with his tool, unlooked-for
sparkles tempt him on; the workman exults in his discovery; behind each
beautiful, strange thought, there is yet another more strange and beautiful still.
Whereas, in this work, every beautiful thought has its way prepared, and every
strange thought loses its power of starting by the exquisite harmony of its
setting. Robertson’s is the glitter of the ore on the bank; Ker’s is the uniform
shining of the wrought metal. We have not seen a volume of sermons for many a
day which will so thoroughly repay both purchase and perusal and re-perusal.
And not the least merit of these sermons is, that they are eminently
suggestive.”—<i>Contemporary Review.</i></p>

<p class='c040'>“The sermons before us are indeed of no common order; among a host of competitors
they occupy a high class—we were about to say the highest class—whether
viewed in point of composition, or thought, or treatment.</p>

<p class='c040'>“He has gone down in the diving-bell of a sound Christian philosophy,
to the very depth of his theme, and has brought up treasures of the
richest and most <i>recherché</i> character, practically showing the
truth of his own remarks in the preface, ‘that there is no department
of thought or action which cannot be touched by that gospel which is
the manifold wisdom of God.’ These subjects he has exhibited in a
style corresponding to their brilliancy and profoundness—terse and
telling, elegant and captivating, yet totally unlike the tinsel
ornaments laid upon the subject by an elaborate process of
manipulation—a style which is the outcome of the sentiment and
feelings within, shaping itself in appropriate drapery.”—<i>British
and Foreign Evangelical Review.</i></p>

<p class='c040'>“Neither a single story nor a batch of tales in a single volume, but a box of six
pretty little books of choice fiction, is Aunt Fanny’s contribution to the new supply
of literary toys for the next children’s season. Imagine the delight of a little girl
who, through the munificence of mamma or godmamma, finds herself possessor of
Aunt Fanny’s tastefully-decorated box. Conceive the exultation with which, on
raising the lid, she discovers that it contains six whole and separate volumes, and
then say, you grown-up folk, whose pockets are bursting with florins, whether you
do not think that a few of your pieces of white money would be well laid out in
purchasing such pleasure for the tiny damsels of your acquaintance, who like to
be sent to bed with the fancies of a pleasant story-teller clothing their sleepy
heads with nightcaps of dreamy contentment. The only objection we can make to
the quality and fashion of Aunt Fanny’s Nightcaps is, that some of their joyous
notions are more calculated to keep infantile wearers awake all night than to dispose
them to slumber. As nightcaps for the daytime, however, they are, one and
all, excellent.”—<i>Athenæum</i>.</p>

<p class='c040'>“We have read this volume with more than ordinary pleasure. In the midst
of so much in modern theological literature that is objectionable or doubtful, it is
refreshing to meet with a clear, manly, outspoken exposition of those great evangelical
doctrines which are in danger of being less ‘commonly believed among us’
than they were among our fathers. The style of the whole book is clear, free, and
vigorous; it is characterised by a tone of sustained eloquence which reminds us
more of the style of Dr. Chalmers than anything we have read for a long time.”—<i>Wesleyan

expiatory sacrifice, nor on that which Luther called ‘<i>Articulus stantis vel cadentis

<p class='c040'>“In our judgment, a more valuable contribution in a single volume to the
exposition, defence, and illustration of evangelical truth has not been often made.
Thoughtful educated Christian laymen, students, and young ministers, will read it
with equal pleasure and profit.”—<i>The Literary World.</i></p>

<p class='c040'>“A handsome welcome book, full of the old Gospel, and rich in tenderness and
feeling, the ripe fruit of an honoured and green old age. The work is conscientiously
and lovingly done, and the result is a treatise on the Prophetic, Priestly, and Kingly
Offices of Our Lord such as will give to all readers much intelligent thought and
much holy and suggestive sentiment. The text gives proof of careful study and
ample scholarship, and it is further enriched with notes taken from recent Biblical
criticism.”—<i>The Freeman.</i></p>

with which M. Van Laun has translated the work.”—<i>The Examiner.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
